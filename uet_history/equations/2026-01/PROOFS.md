# UET Mathematical Proofs

This document consolidates the key mathematical derivations of the Unified Energy Theory.

## 1. Force Derivations

### 1.1 Gravity: E(r) → F = GMm/r²
The gravitational force emerges from the energy gradient of the background field modulated by mass:
- $E(r) = -GMm/r$
- $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla E = -GMm/r^2 \hat{r}$

### 1.2 EM: E(r) → F = kq₁q₂/r²
Electrostatic force arises from the interaction of energy field perturbations caused by electric charge:
- $E(r) = kq_1q_2/r$
- $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla E = kq_1q_2/r^2 \hat{r}$

### 1.3 Strong Force: E(r) → Yukawa
The strong force is modeled via a Yukawa potential in the E-field:
- $V(r) = -g^2 \frac{e^{-mr}}{r}$
- $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla V$ (resulting in short-range attraction)

### 1.4 Weak Force: E(r) → Beta-decay
The weak interaction arises from short-range energy field couplings mediated by massive field excitations:
- Range $\sim 1/M_W$
- $G_F = g^2/(8M_W^2)$

## 2. Quantum Derivations

### 2.1 Planck's Law (E = hf)
Quantization emerges from resonant modes of the energy field E.

### 2.2 Heisenberg Uncertainty
Arises from the minimum wave-packet width in the E-field:
- $\Delta x \Delta p \ge \hbar/2$

## 3. General Relativity Derivations

### 3.1 Einstein Equations
Energy density field E distribution dictates the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$:
- $G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}$ (where $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy field stress-tensor)

### 3.2 Schwarzschild Metric
Derived from a spherical energy point-source in UET.

## 4. Advanced Topics

### 4.1 Spin
Derived from the topological torsion of E-field lines.

### 4.2 Mass Generation
Calculated via the interaction of the field with the vacuum condensate $E_0$.
