# The Cost of Reality: A Thermodynamic Guide to the Universe
(Concise physics-paper style, UET-aligned: BeComing)

**Abstract**:
UET treats physical reality as BeComing: the continual evolution of states under finite resources. By combining (i) thermodynamic cost/efficiency constraints with (ii) finite causal propagation, several “conceptual gaps” between intuition, relativity, and quantum measurement can be reframed as consequences of limited update capacity and record formation. We emphasize operational statements (what can be updated, transmitted, recorded, and read) and keep ontology minimal.

## 0. Minimal Postulates and Notation (No Philosophy)

We model the universe as a system whose physical interactions require finite resources.

*   **State**: $x(t)$ denotes the physical state (or configuration) of a system at time $t$.
*   **BeComing**: the map $t \mapsto x(t)$ (state evolution).
*   **Constraint**: there exists a finite upper bound on causal update / signal propagation speed, denoted $c$.
*   **Cost**: any state update incurs a nonnegative cost $C \ge 0$ (energy/entropy/available free energy budget).

This paper focuses on consequences of finite $c$ and finite resource budgets for state updates (BeComing).

## 1. The Price of BeComing (Cost of Update)

To change state, the system must perform physical work and redistribute energy. In thermodynamic terms, transformations are constrained by conservation laws and entropy production. We therefore treat interactions and state updates as transactions under finite budget.

A generic representation is:

**BeComing requires resources:**

$$ \Delta x \neq 0 \Rightarrow C(\Delta x) > 0 $$

(We do not assume “Being”; we model only dynamical evolution.)

## 2. Speed Limit $c$: Why Zero-Latency Updates Are Impossible

Consider two events separated by spatial distance $\Delta r$. If a system demands instantaneous coordination between them ($\Delta t \to 0$), it demands unbounded update rate.

We encode the finite-causality constraint as:

$$ \Delta r \le c \cdot \Delta t $$

Thus, distance corresponds operationally to the minimum latency required for causal influence. This is not introduced as a narrative claim, but as the standard causal constraint consistent with a finite maximum propagation speed $c$.

## 3. Relativity as Constrained BeComing (Time Dilation)

Special relativity expresses kinematics via invariant proper time:

$$ c^2 d\tau^2 = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2 $$

For inertial motion with speed $v = \|\dot{x}\|$:

$$ d\tau = dt \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$

**UET Interpretation**:
BeComing is constrained—when a trajectory uses more “spatial change per coordinate time” (higher $v$), the proper-time accumulation $d\tau$ per $dt$ decreases. This can be read as a resource-allocation effect under a finite causal speed $c$.

## 4. Observation: Coupling to Delayed State Information

An observer at time $t$ interacting with a source at distance $r$ can only access information consistent with causal delay. Operationally:

$$ \text{data}(t) \text{ depends on } x(t - r/c) $$

(up to medium-dependent delays). Thus “seeing the past” is a direct consequence of finite propagation speed and causal structure.

## 5. Quantum Measurement: Records, Correlations, and Readout

Measurement is modeled as a physical interaction that creates correlations between system $S$ and apparatus/environment $E$:

$$ \rho_S \longrightarrow \rho_{SE} $$

What is experimentally accessible is the readout of records encoded in these correlations. The apparent “collapse” is treated operationally as outcome selection consistent with the available recorded correlations under finite access and thermodynamic constraints.

**Entanglement** corresponds to non-factorizable joint structure:

$$ \rho_{AB} \neq \rho_A \otimes \rho_B $$

Thus, reading $A$ constrains predictions about $B$ because the joint record is correlated—not because information travels superluminally; the constraint is on information structure, not signal speed.

## 6. Conclusion (Engineering View)

UET emphasizes that physical phenomena are manifestations of BeComing under constraints: finite causal propagation ($c$) and thermodynamic cost of updates/records ($C$). In this framing, relativistic timing, observational delay, and measurement outcomes are harmonized as operational consequences of limited update/interaction capacity in a finite system.
