# 🌌 UET Platform Master Blueprint (v5.0 — THE UNIVERSAL CALCULATOR)

## 🎯 Global Mission
To establish the UET Platform as the world's most performant and reliable **Universal Physics Calculator**. By leveraging a high-performance Rust core (`uet_core`) and universal connectivity (MCP), we provide the mathematical substrate for the next generation of scientific AI.

## 🏛️ System Pillars (The 6-Tower Model)

### **Tower 1: External Connectivity (MCP & API)**
- **Global Reach:** Standardized MCP server allowing any LLM (Gemini, Claude, GPT) to "offload" physics thinking to UET.
- **Service Mesh:** UET as a distributed calculation node for research labs.

### **Tower 2: Orchestration (Flow Engine)**
- **Deterministic Paths:** Logical flows that guarantee physical consistency before any answer is returned.
- **Audit Trails:** Full execution graphs for every calculation to ensure reproducibility.

### **Tower 3: Reasoning (Agent Engine)**
- **Multi-Agent RAG:** Research agents that use the Master Equation to rank and verify retrieved knowledge.
- **Physics Auditors:** Specialized agents that sanity-check all mathematical outputs.

### **Tower 4: Knowledge (UKG)**
- **Dynamic Ingestion:** Automated ingestion of new research papers into the Vector + Graph store (Postgres).
- **Axiomatic Linkage:** Every claim in the Knowledge Graph is tied to its physical foundation ($\Omega$-gap score).

### **Tower 5: Infrastructure (Docker/Rust)**
- **Performance First:** Transitioning all heavy math to Rust for sub-millisecond responses.
- **Resilient Stack:** Containerized services (DB, KB, API) with persistent data safety.

### **Tower 6: Interaction (Dashboard & Sim Lab)**
- **Unified Command Center:** A dashboard for tracking API costs, physical field stability, and agent activity.
- **Laboratory simulations:** Interactive environments for visualizing the "Equilibrium State" of complex systems.

## 🚀 The v5.0 Strategy
1. **Connect the World:** Finalize the MCP server to allow external AIs to query the UET "Brain".
2. **Visualize the Field:** Build the dashboard to make high-level physics data accessible to humans.
3. **Automate the Science:** Use the "Marketing Agent" and "Research Agent" to discover and publish new implications of the Master Equation.
