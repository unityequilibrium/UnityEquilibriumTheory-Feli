# 🌌 UET Master Blueprint (v5.0 — THE UNIVERSAL CALCULATOR)

## 🎯 Global Mission
To establish the **Unity Mega-Platform** as the world's most performant and reliable **Universal Physics Calculator**. By leveraging a high-performance Rust core (`uet_core`) and universal connectivity (MCP), we provide the mathematical substrate for the next generation of scientific AI.

## 🏛️ System Pillars (The 6-Tower Model)

### **Tower 1: External Connectivity (MCP & API)**
- **Global Reach:** Standardized MCP server allowing any LLM to "offload" physics thinking to UET.
- **Service Mesh:** UET as a distributed calculation node for research labs.

### **Tower 2: Orchestration (Flow Engine)**
- **Deterministic Paths:** Logical flows that guarantee physical consistency before any answer is returned.
- **Audit Trails:** Full execution graphs for every calculation to ensure reproducibility.

### **Tower 3: Reasoning (Agent Engine)**
- **Multi-Agent RAG:** Research agents that use the Master Equation to rank and verify retrieved knowledge.
- **Intelligence Lab:** Specialized agents collaborating in a virtual environment.

### **Tower 4: Knowledge (UKG)**
- **Dynamic Ingestion:** Automated ingestion into the Vector + Graph store (Postgres).
- **Axiomatic Linkage:** Every claim is tied to its physical foundation ($\Omega$-gap score).

### **Tower 5: Infrastructure (Docker/Rust)**
- **Performance First:** Heavy math in Rust for sub-millisecond responses.
- **Resilient Stack:** Containerized services with persistent data safety.

### **Tower 6: Economy & Interaction (Ledger & Social)**
- **Unity Ledger:** Energy-to-Token mapping using Mathnicry (Quantum-Resistant).
- **PoUW/PoE Commit Layer:** Useful work and equilibrium outputs are committed as machine-verifiable proof certificates, not unverifiable claims.
- **Crypto Baseline:** All ledger-critical objects carry versioned cryptographic metadata (`schema_version`, `sig_alg`, `hash_alg`, `key_id`) for future-safe algorithm rotation.
- **Social Hub:** Collaborative scientific discourse and project management.

## 🔄 Execution Lifecycle (The Heartbeat)

1. **USER/AGENT ACTION**: Request initiated via UI or API.
2. **FLOW CONTROL**: Validation against the System Contract & Permission Matrix.
3. **TASK CLASSIFICATION**: Determining depth (Fast vs. Deep) and Tower routing.
4. **LLM MODEL ROUTING**: Choosing the optimal AI brain for the specific complexity.
5. **RAG RETRIEVAL**: Pulling "Axiomatic Truth" from the UKG (Zero-Stale).
6. **MULTI-AGENT REASONING**: Collaboration within the Intelligence Lab.
7. **TOOL EXECUTION**: Performing calculations, edits, or search.
8. **STATE SYNC**: Event Bus broadcasts changes; Cache invalidated; Knowledge Sync updates versions.
9. **AUDIT LOG**: Execution results finalized and recorded in the Ledger.

## 🛡️ Failure Mode & Recovery
- **Stale Knowledge**: Resolved by **Zero-Stale Policy** (Immediate Cache Invalidation).
- **Routing Drift**: Resolved by **Routing Fallback Matrix**.
- **Agent Loops**: Resolved by **Deterministic Graph Logic** & Step Limits.
- **Sync Mismatch**: Resolved by **Axiomatic Registry Rebuild**.
