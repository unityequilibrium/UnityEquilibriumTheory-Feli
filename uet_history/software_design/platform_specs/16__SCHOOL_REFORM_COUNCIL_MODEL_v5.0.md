# UET v5.0 — School Reform & Council Model

## 1. Vision: The Holistic School Renovation
Schools are transformed into multi-disciplinary hubs that support both traditional and modern fields (Graphics, Coding, Production, Marketing, Printing). The goal is to create a symbiotic relationship between students, their community, and the global UET network.

### 1.1 Field Expansion
- **Modern Studios**: Dedicated labs for Graphic Design, Printing (Local Press), and Code Development.
- **Production & Media**: Supporting student-led production teams for sports (Football, etc.), music bands, and digital influence.
- **Community Service**: Students develop modern, easy-to-use systems (Web/Apps) for local organizations (OrBorTor) in exchange for physical resources.

## 2. The Council Governance System (Saba)
To manage the complexity of multi-disciplinary research, a two-tier council system is established.

### 2.1 The Roundtable Council (Specialized)
- **Focus**: In-depth expertise in a specific field (e.g., The Graphics Council, The Physics Council).
- **Function**: Peer-review of technical research and specialized resource allocation.

### 2.2 The Coordination Council (Interdisciplinary)
- **Focus**: Bringing together experts from diverse fields.
- **Function**: Managing "Production Loops" (e.g., Marketing needs Graphics, Graphics needs Production, Production needs a Football event to film). 
- **Synergy**: Ensures that all departments move together to drive large-scale projects.

## 3. The Student Research Life Cycle
Education is driven by "The Proposal" rather than "The Syllabus".

### 3.1 The Imagination Proof
1. **Ideation**: Students use AI and imagination to identify a problem or a creative goal.
2. **Peer Consensus**: The student proposes the idea to their "Circle" (friends).
3. **Teacher Consultation**: Once peers agree, teachers act as mentors/facilitators.
4. **Council Proposal**: The project is proposed to the relevant Councils for resource requests (Budget, Hardware, Lab access).

## 4. Scaling & Rewards
The system rewards students for bravery and high-impact thinking.

- **Resource Escalation**: Small-scale research happens locally. High-tier research with insufficient local budget is escalated to "Regional" or "Global" Councils.
- **Incentive Structure**: Rewards (Credit/AEU) are given for validated results, community impact, and successful interdisciplinary coordination.
- **Leadership Training**: The system is designed to train "Leaders" who know how to utilize people and resources to create value (The VJK - Management Logic).

## 5. Societal Impact: "Social Media for Thinking"
Results of school projects are uploaded to the UET Social Media layer to:
- **Promote the School**: Showcasing real-world results to the community.
- **Inspire the Network**: Allowing other school nodes to clone or adapt successful research patterns.
- **Attract Funding**: Allowing the "Global Fund" or external sponsors to identify high-potential talent early.
