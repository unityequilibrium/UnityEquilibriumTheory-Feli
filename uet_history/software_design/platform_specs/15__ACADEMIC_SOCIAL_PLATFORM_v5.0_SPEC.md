# UET v5.0 — Academic Collaboration & Social Platform

## 1. Vision: The "Academic Discord" for Global Research
The Academic Social Platform is the user-facing interface for the Decentralized Educational Node (DEN) network. It transforms the platform into a real-time collaborative environment where research data is the secondary currency of interaction.

### 1.1 Core Concept: Project-Based Research Hubs
- **Collaborative Project Rooms**: Similar to Discord servers, but centered around specific scientific objectives or local community problems.
- **Research-as-Status**: Users gain social credibility and "Trust Score" by contributing validated research, not just engagement.
- **Free Data Exchange**: A social media layer where info/insights are shared freely, while raw compute/verification requires AEU (Energy Units).

## 2. Scalable Research Logic
The system scales automatically based on the volume of local data harvested from school communities.

### 2.1 Local Data -> Global Synergy
1. **Local Harvesting**: Students/Researchers collect local community data (e.g., local biodiversity, economic flow, soil health).
2. **Local Research Node**: The school's DEN processes this data using `uet_core` to find patterns.
3. **Global Scaling**: If patterns match those in other regions, the system automatically suggests a **Collaborative Project** between nodes to scale the research globally.

## 3. Social Integration Layer
UET is designed to function as a "Social Media for Thinking".

### 3.1 The Feed (Knowledge Timeline)
- **Verified Insights**: Only results that have passed PoUW verification appear as "High-Density" posts.
- **Collaborative Threading**: Instead of simple replies, threads are organized as "Analysis Loops" or "Equation Refinements".
- **Agent Interjection**: AI Agents (Marketing/Research) automatically curate the feed based on the user's active research projects.

### 3.2 Interaction Dynamics (Discord-Style)
- **Voice/Video/Canvas**: Integrated collaborative canvases where multiple researchers can tweak `uet_core` parameters in real-time.
- **Project Bootstrapping**: A user can "Open a Project" which automatically spins up an MCP-compliant shared knowledge space across multiple DEN nodes.

## 4. Scaling Architecture (The "Expandable" Core)
The software is designed to expand horizontally as more schools join.

- **Storage Scaling**: Distributed Vector DB shards across school clusters.
- **Compute Scaling**: Dynamic workload balancing between idle school servers.
- **Social Scaling**: Communities are organized into "Interest Clusters" (Sub-Worlds) to prevent info-bloat and maintain high-density discussion.

## 5. Security & Academic Integrity
- **Peer Review Loops**: Social interactions (likes/shares) are replaced by "Scientific Verifications" where peers run calculations on their own nodes to verify a post's claim.
- **Anti-Plagiarism Mesh**: The Knowledge Sync engine automatically flags duplicated research data across the mesh.
