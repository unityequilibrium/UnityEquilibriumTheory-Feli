# UET v5.0 — Mathnicry Economic Constitution

## 1. The First Law of UET Economics
"Value is never created from void, only transformed from Energy."
The UET economy follows the **First Law of Thermodynamics**. Electrical energy consumed by CPU cycles for scientific calculation is transformed into **Axiomatic Knowledge**, which serves as the physical backing for the **UET Coin**.

## 2. Direct CPU Mining (Scientific PoUW)
Unlike traditional blockchains that use random hashing, UET mining is **functional** and **direct**.
- **The Engine**: Every machine running the UET platform utilizes `uet_core` to process data (posts, RAG, knowledge sync).
- **The Work**: Each calculation solves a fragment of the UET Master Equation or a scientific simulation.
- **The Reward**: Successive valid calculations generate fragments of UET Coin. Using the platform *is* mining.

## 3. Anti-Inflation & Asset Backing
To prevent the "Easy Production" problem, UET Coins are backed by a multi-layered **Global Asset Reserve**:
1.  **Energy (50%)**: Stored electrical/thermal potential verified by state utilities.
2.  **Land (30%)**: Real-world territory managed via the UET Land Reform contracts.
3.  **Hard Assets (20%)**: Bitcoin, Gold, and verified technological patents.

## 4. Socio-Economic Equity (The 50/50 Model)
To ensure global stability and shared responsibility, equity is distributed as follows:
- **State Ownership (50%)**: Managed by the global governors for resource maintenance and the 1st Law cycle.
- **Citizen Ownership (50%)**: Distributed to every human.
- **Liquidity Restriction**: Citizens can trade up to **25%** of their total equity. The remaining **25%** must be held as "Shared Responsibility" to maintain their status as active participants in the global ecosystem.

## 5. The Negotiation (Equilibrium) Bonus
Traditional trade is zero-sum. UET rewards **Equilibrium**.
- **Direct Trade**: Standard transaction at set price.
- **Negotiated Trade**: If parties use the AI Agent to negotiate a price that optimizes both surpluses, the system grants a **Negotiation Bonus** derived from the mining reserve.
- **Social Impact**: This incentivizes human interaction and socio-economic harmony.

## 6. Global Land Reform
UET ends land speculation by shifting to a **State-Lease Model**.
- **Ownership**: All land title is held by the Collective State (backed by UET Coin).
- **Leasing**: Citizens receive "Lease Rights" for life, paid for or subsidized by their 50% dividend.
- **Conversion**: Private land owners can exit to the UET system in exchange for UET Coins and guaranteed lifetime lease rights.

## 7. The Thermodynamic Loop
1.  **Burn**: CPU consumes Electricity.
2.  **Work**: `uet_core` solves physics/math.
3.  **Coin**: Work units minted as UET Coin.
4.  **Re-invest**: 50% of State coin used to maintain energy/resource infrastructure.
5.  **Repeat**: Loop closes, preventing energy loss from the system.
