# UET Theory & History Management

This directory contains the core theoretical components and development history of the Unified Excitable Theory (UET).

## 🏛️ Theory Repository (`theory/`)
Theoretical content is organized by domain. This folder contains only the **pure conceptual frameworks** and axiomatic definitions.
- **`00_foundation`**: Ontological basics, core axioms, and existence frameworks.
- **`01_physics`**: Laws of Thermodynamics, Energy, Field equations, and Physical dynamics.
- **`02_psychology`**: Mind, Perception, Frame of Reference, and Epistemology.
- **... (03-10)**: Ethics, Law, Politics, Economics, Technology, Organization, Future.

## 🕰️ Consolidated Archives (`archives/`)
Historical backups and large data collections are merged here to minimize clutter.
- **`backups/`**: Zipped snapshots of various development stages (e.g., `v0.8.6.zip`).
- **`data_collections/`**: Dated subdirectories containing raw research data and previous environment states.

## 🔬 Development Activity (`research/` & `equations/`)
Developmental details, experimental logs, and mathematical iterations are archived here, organized by **month** to track the evolution of the theory.

### 🔬 Research Archive (`research/`)
Contains research topics, validation reports, data audits, and logic logs.
- **Structure**: `research/[YYYY-MM]/` (e.g., `2026-01/`)

### ➗ Equation Archive (`equations/`)
Contains technical specifications, parameter iterations, and formula development logs.
- **Structure**: `equations/[YYYY-MM]/` (e.g., `2026-01/`)
