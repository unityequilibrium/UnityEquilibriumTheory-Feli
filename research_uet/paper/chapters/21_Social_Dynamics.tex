\section{Society as a Many-Body System (Topic 0.26)}
Human societies are complex adaptive systems governed by the same information principles as particle fluids. "Culture" is the shared informational scaffold (Metric) that reduces the interaction cost between individuals.

\section{Polarization as Phase Separation}
Using the Ising Model analog (from Topic 0.11), social polarization is a phase transition.
\begin{itemize}
    \item At High Temperature (Tolerance/Noise), opinions are mixed (Paramagnetic).
    \item Below Critical Temperature ($T_c$), the society spontaneously fractures into opposing domains (Ferromagnetic domains). Social media algorithms effectively "lower the temperature" (reduce noise/exposure to diverse views), accelerating this fracture.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cliodynamics}
Historical cycles (rise and fall of empires) are modeled as "Secular Cycles" of resource accumulation (Entropy reduction) followed by capacity overshoot and collapse (Entropy maximisation).
