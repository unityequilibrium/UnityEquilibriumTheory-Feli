\section{Geometric Origin of Mass (Topic 0.17)}
UET rejects the arbitrary Higgs mechanism for mass generation. Instead, mass is defined as "Resistance to Information Update."
\begin{equation}
    m \propto \int (\nabla C)^2 dV
\end{equation}
Particles with higher curvature in the $C$-field (like the Top Quark) resist updates more strongly, manifesting as higher mass.

\subsection{The Koide Formula}
The engine \texttt{Engine\_Mass\_Higgs.py} verifies that lepton masses (electron, muon, tau) satisfy the geometric relation:
\begin{equation}
    Q = \frac{\sum \sqrt{m_i}^2}{\sum m_i} = 1.5
\end{equation}
This "Golden Ratio of Physics" suggests that leptons are resonant harmonics of the same fundamental loop.

\section{Electroweak Unification (Topic 0.6)}
The Weinberg Angle ($\theta_W$) is derived geometrically as the projection angle between the Electric Force (Surface) and the Weak Force (Volume).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prediction:} $\sin^2 \theta_W = 0.231$ (Derived from geometry).
    \item \textbf{Interpretation:} The Weak force is the "twist" of the manifold, while Electromagnetism is the "stretch."
\end{itemize}
