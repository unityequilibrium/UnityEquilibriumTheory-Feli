\section{The Mass Problem}
The Standard Model assumes neutrinos are massless, but oscillation experiments prove otherwise. UET derives neutrino mass not from a Higgs coupling, but from "Geometric Friction" ($\kappa \cdot I$) as the particle tunnels through the manifold.

\section{Oscillation from Geometry (Topic 0.7)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engine:} \texttt{Engine\_Neutrino.py}
    \item \textbf{Result:} Mass splittings ($\Delta m^2$) are derived as beat frequencies of the neutrino wavepacket interacting with the discrete grid spacing.
    \item \textbf{Mixing Angles:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\theta_{12} \approx \pi/6$ (Solar) due to Hexagonal lattice symmetry.
        \item $\theta_{23} \approx \pi/4$ (Atmospheric) due to Maximal Mixing.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{No Sterile Neutrinos}
UET explains anomalies (like LSND/MiniBooNE) without introducing new "sterile" particles. These are interpreted as phase shifts in the Information Field itself, localized distortions that mimic particle behavior.
