\section{Superconductivity as Topological Locking (Topic 0.4)}
Standard BCS theory explains low-Tc superconductivity, but fails for High-Tc. UET models electrons as a fluid that "locks" into a topological state at low thermal noise (Temperature).
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meissner Effect:} Explained by the incompressibility of the UET Information Fluid. Magnetic field lines (vortices) are expelled because they cannot penetrate the "solidified" information lattice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (Topic 0.12)}
While controversial, UET provides a theoretical framework for LENR phenomena via "Geometric Resonance." If the lattice can be induced to vibrate at specific nuclear frequencies, the Coulomb barrier can be effectively lowered by the "screening" effect of the high-density information field, allowing tunneling rates to increase by orders of magnitude.
