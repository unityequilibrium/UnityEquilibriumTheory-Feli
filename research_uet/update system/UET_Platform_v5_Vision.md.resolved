# 🌌 UET Master Platform Blueprint (v5.0 — Universal Physics Vision)

## 🎯 Platform Mission: The Universal Physics Calculator
The UET Platform is evolving from a research tool into a **Global Mathematical Utility**. The core objective is to make `uet_core` (High-performance Rust Engine) the definitive source of truth for physical field calculations, accessible to any AI agent or system worldwide via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

## 🏛️ Strategic Architecture (Tower 1-6)

### **Tower 1: The Universal Interface (MCP + API)**
- **MCP Bridge:** Expose `compute_omega`, `compute_kappa`, and `validate_field` as standardized MCP tools.
- **AI-to-AI Protocol:** Allow other LLMs (DeepSeek, GPT, Claude) to use UET as a "Thinking Co-processor" for physics.
- **REST/WebSocket API:** High-speed endpoints for real-time simulation data.

### **Tower 2: Flow & Orchestration 2.0**
- **Deterministic Routing:** Use the `FlowEngine` to ensure that every physical calculation is verified by a "Physics Auditor" agent.
- **Cross-Agent Memory:** Persistent memory for agents across container restarts (using Postgres).

### **Tower 3: Reasoning & Verification**
- **Physics-Informed RAG:** Use the Ω-gap to rank information relevance, ensuring that retrieved research aligns with the current physical state of the simulation.
- **Verification Loop:** Every response must contain a "Physical Consistency score" derived from `uet_core`.

### **Tower 4: The KB & Unified Knowledge Graph (UKG)**
- **Postgres + pgvector:** Scalable storage for 1M+ research artifacts.
- **Graph Linkage:** Connect mathematical equations directly to their research origin and empirical validation logs.

### **Tower 5: The System & Data Layer**
- **Dockerized Multi-Engine:** High-availability stack (Postgres, KB-Server, Orchestrator, Monitoring).
- **Persistent Volumes:** Secure, optimized storage for vector data.

### **Tower 6: The Action & Simulation Layer (NEW)**
- **Simulation Lab:** An engine for visual physics experiments (Web-based or Game Engine integrated).
- **Social Marketing Agent:** Automated dissemination of validated physics findings to research networks.

## 📊 The Unified Dashboard (The Command Center)

### **1. API & Cost Intelligence**
- Real-time spend tracking across all models.
- Budget enforcement status.
- Agent performance vs. cost efficiency.

### **2. Physics Telemetry**
- **Ω-Gap Visualization:** Monitoring the stability of the current field.
- **Coherence Tracking:** Measuring the alignment of ingested knowledge.
- **Parameter Heatmaps:** Visualizing the distribution of $\kappa$ and $\beta$ across domains.

### **3. Multi-Agent Coordination**
- Live task tree showing what each agent (~Planner, Research, Math, Marketing~) is doing.
- Reasoning step-by-step audit logs.
