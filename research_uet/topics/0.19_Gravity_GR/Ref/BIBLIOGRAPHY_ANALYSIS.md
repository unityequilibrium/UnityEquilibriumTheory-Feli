# 📚 UET Gravity & GR: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Space-time does not tell matter how to move; the Unity Field is the medium through which curvature propagates."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Gravity as Manifold Tension" model. We connect our findings to Einstein's Field Equations, Schwarzschild's vacuum solution, and the detection of gravitational waves.

## 1. The Foundation: General Relativity (GR)
**Seminal Work:** Albert Einstein (1915).

### The Connection
Einstein revolutionized physics by showing that gravity is the curvature of spacetime ($G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}$).
*   **GR View:** Spacetime is a smooth manifold that curves in response to energy-momentum.
*   **UET's View:** Spacetime is the **Unity Field Lattice**. Curvature ($G_{\mu\nu}$) is the **Average Manifold Tension** ($\langle\kappa\rangle$) across a macroscopic volume. UET derives Einstein's equations as the "Low-Resolution Limit" of the Master Equation.
*   **Result:** By mapping the Unity terms to the stress-energy tensor, UET resolves the "singularity" problem of GR, as the lattice resolution ($a$) provides a physical cutoff for curvature.

## 2. The Vacuum: The Schwarzschild Solution
**Seminal Work:** Karl Schwarzschild (1916).

### The Connection
The first exact solution to Einstein's equations, describing the field of a point mass (Black Hole foundation).
*   **Schwarzschild View:** A singularity at $r=0$ and an event horizon at $r_s$.
*   **UET's View:** A Black Hole is a **Lattice Dislocation**. The event horizon is the boundary where the Unity Field's phase coherence breaks. Instead of a singularity, UET predicts a "Lattice Core" where the Unity Wavefunction exists in a state of maximum tension saturation.

## 3. The Ripple: Gravitational Waves
**Seminal Work:** LIGO Scientific Collaboration (2016).

### The Connection
Direct detection of ripples in spacetime from a binary black hole merger (GW150914).
*   **LIGO Result:** Gravity propagates at $c$ as a transverse wave.
*   **UET's View:** Gravitational waves are **Manifold Vibrations**. These are the "Transverse Modes" of the Unity Lattice. UET predicts a specific "Gravitational Polarization" that slightly differs from GR at very high frequencies, serving as a vital probe for the lattice structure.
