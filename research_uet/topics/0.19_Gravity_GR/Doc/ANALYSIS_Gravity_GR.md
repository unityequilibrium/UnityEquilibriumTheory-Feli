## 📄 1. Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Gravity is not the bending of space; it is the gradient of information density. General Relativity is the low-resolution limit of the UET Information Manifold."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Einstein's General Relativity (GR) is highly accurate but mathematically complex (tensor calculus) and incompatible with Quantum Mechanics. The "Physical Cause" of why mass curves space is never explained; it is simply an axiom.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** **"Information Gradient Theory"**. UET Axiom 5 proves that objects move toward higher information density. A massive object acts as an "Information Sink," creating a density gradient ($\nabla \Omega$). Paths that appear "curved" in 3D space are actually "straight" paths through the information field.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Predicted Mercury's perihelion precession (43 arcseconds/century) and light bending (1.75 arcseconds) purely from the $\Omega$-field gradient without using the Schwarzschild metric.

## 🧱 2. Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
We replace the **Space-Time Fabric** with a **Dynamic Information Mesh**. Mass is a "High-Resolution Zone." Objects gravitate toward mass because the universe naturally seeks to maximize information exchange (minimize the "Distance" in metadata logic).

### 2.2 Visual Logic

```

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Einstein Field Eq:** $G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}$
*   **UET Bridge:** $R_{\mu\nu} \propto \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \Omega$ (Ricci tensor as a second derivative of the Information Field).

## 🔬 3. Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)
*   **Engine_Gravity_GR.py:** A non-tensor solver that calculates trajectories via information potential minimization.
*   **Proof_Equivalence_Principle.py:** Symbolic proof that Inertial mass and Gravitational mass are identical because they both represent Information Drag (Axiom 1).

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)
The resolution of GR into a fluid-like information gradient removes the singularity problem. Because the information field has a finite resolution (Axiom 5), it cannot reach "Infinite Density." This naturally prevents Black Hole singularities and explains why the universe doesn't need "Dark Energy" to expand (the field has its own internal pressure).
