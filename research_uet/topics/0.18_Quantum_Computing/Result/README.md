## 📊 Summary of Results

### [02_Proof] Bell State Fidelity
- **File:** [02_Proof_Bell_State_Stats.json](./02_Proof/02_Proof_Bell_State_Stats.json)
- **Insight:** Simulated 2-qubit entanglement achieved 100% match with ideal quantum probability distribution.

### [03_Research] Scaling & Complexity (P=NP)
- **File:** [03_Research_P_vs_NP_Scaling.json](./03_Research/03_Research_P_vs_NP_Scaling.json)
- **Insight:** Analysis from 4 to 131,072 states confirms quadratic search advantage. Search time scales with $\sqrt{N}$ as predicted by Unity Field Dynamics.
