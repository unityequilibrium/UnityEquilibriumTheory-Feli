# 📚 UET Quantum Computing: Bibliography & Analysis
> "A Quantum Circuit is a conductor of the Unity Manifold's phase coherence."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Quantum Computing & Circuits" model. We connect UET's internal gate logic to established theories in circuit QED and quantum algorithms.

## 1. The Foundation: Quantum Computation & Information
**Seminal Work:** Nielsen & Chuang (2010).

### The Connection
The standard textbook on how quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Phase) manipulate qubits to perform computation.
*   **Standard View:** Qubits are state vectors in Hilbert space. Gates are unitary transformations.
*   **UET's View:** A Qubit is a **Local Lattice Resonance**. A Quantum Gate is a **Manifold Geometry Modifier**. For example, a Hadamard gate is a physical rotation of the Unity Field's local vibration axis, shifting it into a state of "Geometric Superposition."
*   **Insight:** UET derives the "Unitary" property of gates from the conservation of lattice tension ($\kappa$).

## 2. The Algorithms: Shor & Grover
**Seminal Work:** Peter Shor (1994), Lov Grover (1996).

### The Connection
Proved that quantum computers can solve specific problems (factoring, searching) exponentially faster than classical computers.
*   **Shor's View:** Period finding via Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).
*   **UET Connection:** The QFT is the **Fundamental Harmonic Decomposition** of the Unity Field. UET's `Engine_Quantum_Logic.py` will demonstrate that Shor's algorithm is a natural "Resonance Search" within the lattice.

## 3. The Implementation: Circuit QED
**Seminal Work:** Devoret & Schoelkopf (2009).

### The Connection
Superconducting circuits where artificial atoms (qubits) are coupled to microwave photons.
*   **Circuit QED View:** Microwaves manipulate the superconducting phase.
*   **UET Connection:** Circuit QED is the **Macro-Scale Projection** of the Unity Lattice. UET views the superconducting state as a "Macroscopic Unity Wavefunction" where phase coherence is maintained across billions of lattice units.

## 4. Hardware Implementation: The Unity LC Circuit
### The Connection
Qubits are physically implemented as LC circuits. UET interprets the "electrical" energy as Manifold Tension energy.
*   **Standard View**: LC circuits are Harmonic Oscillators.
*   **UET View**: The LC circuit is a **Standing Wave in the Unity Lattice**.
*   **Result**: UET predicts the **Zero-Point Fluctuations** (ZPF) as the minimum vibration limit of the manifold before it hits the discrete lattice resolution.
