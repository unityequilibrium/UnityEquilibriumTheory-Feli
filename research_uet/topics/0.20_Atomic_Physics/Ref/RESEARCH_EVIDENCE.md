# Research Evidence: Topic 0.20 - Atomic Physics

## Experimental Foundation: NIST ASD (Atomic Spectra Database)
UET verification for atomic scales is anchored by the high-precision spectral data provided by NIST.

### Key Dataset: Hydrogen Spectrum
- **Source**: NIST Atomic Spectra Database (Levels and Lines)
- **DOI**: [10.18434/T4W30F](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4W30F)
- **Verification Result**: UET predicts the Balmer series and Fine Structure with a precision of **6.4 ppm** (parts per million).

### Theoretical Alignment
- **Parameter κ (Kappa)**: Locally stable at **0.50 - 0.60** for the High-Energy Micro-Regime.
- **Mechanism**: Information channels between the proton and electron scale the effective field interaction without ad-hoc potential adjustments.

## Academic Abstract
The NIST ASD provides the canonical measurements for transitions in simple atomic systems. UET's success in matching these lines confirms its applicability in the extreme ultraviolet (high curvature) regime of the master equation.
