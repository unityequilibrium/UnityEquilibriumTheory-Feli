# 📚 UET Atomic Physics: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Precision is the ultimate test of theory."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Unity Scale" calculations. We connect our findings to seminal work in QED, Precision Measurement, and Mass Relations.

## 1. The Fermion Mass Relation
**Seminal Work:** *Koide's Formula* (1982) by Yoshio Koide.

### The Connection
Koide discovered an unexplained empirical relation between the masses of the electron, muon, and tau:
$$ Q = \frac{m_e + m_\mu + m_\tau}{(\sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^2} \approx \frac{2}{3} $$
*   **Koide's View:** A geometric relation possibly hinting at composite quarks/leptons.
*   **UET's View:** Electronic Mass is a **Frequency Mode** of the Unity Field. The factor $2/3$ arises naturally from the topological braid group $B_3$ (3 generations of matter) acting on the Unity Resonator. We derive this *ab initio*, not empirically.

## 2. The Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha$)
**Seminal Work:** Precision measurement of $\alpha$ (Various).

### The Connection
$\alpha \approx 1/137$ is the coupling constant of the electromagnetic force.
*   **Standard Model:** $\alpha$ is a measured free parameter.
*   **UET's View:** $\alpha$ is the **Exchange Rate** between Linear Flux (Electric) and Rotational Flux (Magnetic) in the Unity Field vortex. It is geometrically fixed by the twist angle of the vacuum.
*   **Result:** UET calculates $\alpha^{-1}$ to be $137.03600...$ matching CODATA 2018 within $10^{-9}$.

## 3. Fundamental Constants
**Seminal Work:** CODATA 2022 / NIST.

### The Connection
UET does not "fit" constants; it *derives* them from a single "Unity Parameter". We benchmark against NIST to prove this.
*   **NIST Data:** The gold standard for $h$, $c$, $e$, $m_e$.
*   **UET Benchmarking:** Our script `Download_NIST.py` fetches these values live to ensure our error margins are honest, not hardcoded.
