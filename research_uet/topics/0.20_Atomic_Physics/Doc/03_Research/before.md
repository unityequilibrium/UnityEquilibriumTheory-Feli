# 🚧 Limitation: Atomic Physics

## Problem Statement

### The Classical View
Bohr model successfully predicts hydrogen spectrum but:
- **Ad-hoc quantization** — why are orbits quantized?
- **No mechanism** — what determines energy levels?

### Key Question
**Why E_n = -R_∞hc/n²?** (Why this specific formula?)

## Historical Context

| Theory | Achievement | Limitation |
|:-------|:------------|:-----------|
| Bohr (1913) | Hydrogen spectrum | Ad-hoc quantum condition |
| Schrödinger | Wave mechanics | Mathematical, not physical |
| QED | Lamb shift, g-2 | Complex, perturbative |

---

## The Gap

1. **Quantization assumed** — not derived from first principles
2. **No information basis** — why these specific energy levels?
3. **Rydberg constant** — derived but not explained

---

## Necessity for UET

- Need framework where quantization **emerges naturally**
- Need atomic levels as **information channel capacities**
- Need Rydberg formula from **thermodynamic constraints**
