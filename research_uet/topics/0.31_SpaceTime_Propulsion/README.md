## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Chemical rockets are fuel-limited with low delta-V. Achieving relativistic velocities (0.1c+) is impossible with current technology due to exponential fuel requirements.
- **The Solution:** UET proposes **Transient Singularities** - micro-black holes (100-ton class) that exist only during acceleration. By using the $\Omega$-Field to amplify gravitational coupling, we perform hyper-accelerated slingshots.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** All acceleration is achieved through spacetime warping, not onboard fuel mass.
