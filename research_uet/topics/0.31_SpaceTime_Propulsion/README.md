# 🌌 Research Protocol: Topic 0.31 (Space-Time Propulsion)
> **Objective:** Achieve Relativistic Velocity via Transient Singularities.

## 1. The Hypothesis
"By utilizing the UET $\Omega$-Field to amplify gravitational coupling, we can perform hyper-accelerated slingshots around micro-singularities that evaporate via Hawking Radiation before ship passage, achieving $0.1c+$ without onboard fuel."

## 2. Theoretical Basis
*   **Omega Coupling:** High-density information fields amplify gravitational interaction at the sub-nano scale.
*   **Transient Singularities:** Micro-black holes (100-ton class) that exist only for the duration of the acceleration phase.
*   **Delta-V:** Non-Newtonian momentum gain via spacetime warping.

## 1. 📂 5x4 Grid Structure (Scientific Architecture)
*   `Code/01_Engine`: Relativistic Sling Engine with Hawking Decay.
*   `Code/02_Proof`: Multistage acceleration logs.
*   `Doc`: Conceptual design and safety analysis.
*   `Result`: Acceleration curves and velocity milestones.

## 2. ⚡ Quick Start (Run Commands)

```powershell
# Run the core slingshot simulation
python research_uet/topics/0.31_SpaceTime_Propulsion/Code/01_Engine/Engine_Slingshot_v2.py
```
*   **Proof 01:** Reach 10% of light speed within 100 slingshots.
*   **Success Metric:** $V > 0.1c$ with zero fuel mass expended.
