🚀 UET PROOF 05: THE LIGHT-SPEED APPROACH
=========================================
Scenario: Exiting Solar System & Activating Interstellar SGS
Current Position: 1.0 AU (Earth Orbit)
🛑 SAFETY BREACH: Too close to Solar System ( < 100 AU). Use Planetary Slingshot instead.
... Moving to Interstellar Vacuum (Heliopause) ...
✅ CLEAR: Interstellar Space. SGS Authorized.

Target Velocity: 29,979,246 m/s (0.1c)
Initial Velocity: 11,000 m/s
