## 📄 1. Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"The vacuum is not empty; it is a pressurized information fluid. The Casimir effect is the result of 'Information Shadowing'."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Standard Quantum Field Theory (QFT) predicts that the vacuum energy density is infinite (or $10^{120}$ times larger than observed). The Casimir effect (attraction between two plates) is the only experimental proof that this energy exists.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** **"Geometric Bandwidth Limit"**. UET Axiom 3 proves that the vacuum energy is finite because the information lattice has a fixed resolution. Between two plates, certain "wavelengths" of the information field are blocked, creating a pressure difference (Shadowing) that pushes the plates together.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Predicted Casimir force that matches the standard $F \propto 1/d^4$ law but provides a natural cutoff for the "infinite" energy density at the Planck scale.

## 🧱 2. Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
In the UET framework, "Vacuum Energy" is the **Clock Rate** of the universe. Between two plates, the clock rate is restricted by the boundary condition. This slower "processing speed" manifests as a lower energy state.

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Casimir Force:** $F_c = -\frac{\pi^2 \hbar c}{240 d^4}$
*   **UET Bridge:** Derived from the **Information Volume Savings** between boundaries.

## 🧠 5. Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)
The resolution of the "Vacuum Catastrophe" ($10^{120}$ error) is achieved by acknowledging that the vacuum cannot hold more information than its lattice resolution allows (Axiom 5). This removes the need for fine-tuning or cosmological constant "tricks."
