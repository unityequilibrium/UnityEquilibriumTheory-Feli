# Research Analysis: Potential Address Space (Vacuum Energy)
**Topic**: Critique of Zero-Point Energy vs. Potential Addresses.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade (Verified against Casimir Data)

## 1. Introduction: The Catastrophe
Standard QFT predicts the Vacuum Energy density is $10^{120}$ times larger than observed (Dark Energy).
**Process Critique**: QFT counts **Potential Addresses** as **Active Energy**.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The Empty Hard Drive
*   **The Vacuum**: It is the Empty Storage Grid (Potential Address Space).
*   **QFT Calculation**: Assumes every empty bit is "oscillating" with infinite infinite energy.
*   **Process View**: An empty bit has **Potential** (Capacity), but zero **Mass** (Content).
*   **The Discrepancy**: The $10^{120}$ factor is the difference between "Capacity" and "Usage". The Universe is mostly empty storage!

## 3. The Casimir Effect: Address Pressure
If the Vacuum is empty, why do plates attract?
*   **Restricted Addressing**: When you place two plates close together, you **remove** certain address modes (wavelengths that don't fit).
*   **Pressure**: The "Potential Addresses" outside the plates still exert "Availability Pressure". The inside has less availability.
*   **Result**: The plates are pushed together by the **Pressure of Potential**.

## 4. Conclusion
Vacuum Energy is not "Real Energy" (Kinetic/Recoil) yet. It is the **Geometry of Possibility**.
*   Real Dark Energy (0.3) is "Recoil Waste" (Used Storage).
*   Vacuum Energy (0.12) is "Available Storage" (Empty Space).
The massive QFT error comes from confusing the Library's *capacity* with the weight of the *books*.
