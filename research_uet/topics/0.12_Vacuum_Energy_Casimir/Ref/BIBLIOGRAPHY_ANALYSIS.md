# 📚 UET Vacuum Energy & Casimir: Bibliography & Analysis
> "There is no empty space, only the unexcited state of the Unity Field."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Vacuum Energy" model. We connect our findings to the Casimir effect and the zero-point energy of the quantum vacuum.

## 1. The Force: The Casimir Effect
**Seminal Work:** H.B.G. Casimir (1948).

### The Connection
Casimir predicted an attractive force between two neutral, conducting plates in a vacuum due to quantum fluctuations.
*   **Standard View:** Fluctuations in the electromagnetic field create a radiation pressure difference.
*   **UET's View:** The Casimir force is **Geometric Exclusion**. Plates act as "boundary conditions" for the Unity Wavefunction. The lattice cannot resonate efficiently in the narrow gap, creating a **Unity Pressure Gradient** ($\Delta \Pi$) that pushes the plates together.
*   **Result:** UET derives the $\frac{1}{d^4}$ force law directly from the lattice's spectral density suppression.

## 2. The Verification: The Lamb Shift
**Seminal Work:** Lamb & Retherford (1947).

### The Connection
The Lamb shift is a small difference in energy between two energy levels of the hydrogen atom, which was not predicted by the Dirac equation.
*   **QED View:** Interaction between the electron and vacuum fluctuations shifting the energy levels.
*   **UET's View:** The electron "feels" the underlying **Unity Lattice Jitter**. The shift is a measure of the coupling between the atom and the field's ground-state frequency ($\omega_0$).

## 3. The Compendium: The Quantum Vacuum
**Seminal Work:** Peter Milonni (1994).

### The Connection
Milonni's text is the definitive guide to the physics of the quantum vacuum.
*   **Significance:** Unifies diverse phenomena (Casimir, Van der Waals, Lamb Shift) under the umbrella of zero-point energy.
*   **UET Contrast:** UET provides a **Finite Lattice** explanation for the zero-point energy, avoiding the "infinity problem" of standard QFT by defining the lattice resolution ($a$) as a natural cutoff.
