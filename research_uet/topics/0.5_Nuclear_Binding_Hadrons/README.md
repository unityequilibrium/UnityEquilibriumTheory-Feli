## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** The standard Liquid Drop Model requires 5-7 parameters tuned to specific ranges of the periodic table. It often struggles with very light nuclei or the exact range of the force.
- **The Solution:** UET models nucleons as Information Fields. The binding energy comes from the **Overlap** of these fields (reducing total entropy). We upgraded the engine to include the **Yukawa Potential** ($e^{-mr}/r$), providing the correct range behavior for the Strong Force.
- **Integrity Check:**
    - **Success:** 99% pass rate across 83 isotopes.
    - **Resolved:** Deuteron (H-2) previously had high error, but the new **Light Nuclei Solver** (Geometric Overlap) reduced error to **0.4%**.
