# 🧮 Proof Analysis: Color Confinement

## Why Can't Quarks Be Free?

### Standard Answer (QCD)
Lattice QCD simulations show that the potential between quarks grows linearly with distance:
$$ V(r) = -\frac{4}{3}\frac{\alpha_s}{r} + \sigma r $$

The second term (string tension $\sigma \approx 0.44$ GeV/fm) means you need infinite energy to separate quarks.

### UET Answer
The linear potential arises because **gluons carry color charge**.
- Photons are neutral → EM field spreads ($1/r^2$).
- Gluons are colored → Gluon field **concentrates**.

In UET terms:
- The C-I field forms a "flux tube" between quarks.
- Flux tube has constant cross-section (Information cannot dilute).
- Energy per length = String Tension = Constant.

**Key Insight:** Confinement is **Information Condensation** at low energy.

## Known Limitations

### Light Nuclei (A < 10)
The `Research_Nuclear_Binding.py` script uses a modified Bethe-Weizsäcker formula.
This formula is a **semi-empirical model** (not first-principles).
It fails for light nuclei (H2, H3, He3, He4) because:
1. Shell effects are dominant.
2. Pairing energy is not well-modeled.
3. Surface tension term breaks down.

**This is NOT a UET failure.** It's a domain limitation of the liquid-drop model.

For accurate light nuclei, use the **ab-initio nuclear structure** approach (future work).
