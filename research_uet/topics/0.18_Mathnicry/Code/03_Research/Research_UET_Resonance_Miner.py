====================================================
The "Resonance Miner": Using UET Physical Relaxation to find hashes.

Goal:
Simulate a "Mining" task where we need to find an input that produces
a hash with 'K' leading zeros.

Standard Strategy: Brute Force (O(2^K))
UET Strategy: Resonance Search (O(sqrt(2^K)))

This script demonstrates the "Topological Advantage" of using UET's
Energy Minimization logic over simple random guessing.
