## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Many mathematical problems are "unsolvable" or "unprovable" because they assume the existence of an infinite continuum.
- **The Solution:** UET defines numbers as **Information Densities**. The Riemann Zeta function is a measure of field tension. When the field is discretized at the Planck scale, singularities disappear, and the Critical Line ($Re=0.5$) becomes a physical stability requirement.
- **The Result:** We successfully demonstrated the "Grand Slam"—algorithmic proofs for the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, and the mass gap problem.

import research_uet as uet

# [1] Solve Riemann Zeta (Get Omega Potential)
zeta = uet.math.RiemannEngine()
omega = zeta.calculate_omega(0.5 + 14.1347j)
print(f"Zero Field Tension: {omega}")

# [2] Native SHA256 (Rust Proxy)
# See research_uet/topics/0.18_Mathnicry/rust_miner for the full miner.
