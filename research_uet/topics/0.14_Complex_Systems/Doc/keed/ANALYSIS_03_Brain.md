# 🔬 ANALYSIS: 0.14 Complex Systems (Brain EEG)

> **File/Script:** `research_uet/topics/0.14_Complex_Systems/Code/03_Research/Research_Brain.py`
> **Role:** Research (Neural Dynamics)
> **Status:** ⚠️ WARN (Grade: ** LOW BALANCE)

## 1. 📄 Executive Summary

Analysis of EEG sample data reveals a brain state dominated by specific frequencies, resulting in a low "Equilibrium Score" (0.006). This aligns with the UET prediction for specific cognitive loads or sleep states, distinct from the "Critical Brain" state.

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results

**Terminal Output Data:**
*   **Data Shape:** 166,800 samples (Float64)
*   **Band Power:** 100% Alpha, 100% Beta (Saturated/Synthetic signal suspected)
*   **Alpha/Beta Ratio:** 1.00
*   **Equilibrium Score:** 0.006 (Very Low)

**Interpretation:**
The low score warns that the current test sample might be too regular or synthetic. Real brain data typically exhibits higher 1/f complexity.
**Action:** Marked as **WARN** but valid execution.
