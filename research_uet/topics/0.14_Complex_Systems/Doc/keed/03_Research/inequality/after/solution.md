# UET Research Solution: Global Inequality & Potential Gradients

## 1. Theoretical Framework
In UET, inequality is not just a social metric but a physical **Potential Gradient** ($\nabla \Phi$).
$$ J_{migration} \propto - \nabla \Phi_{econ} $$

People, capital, and resources naturally flow to minimize their local potential (maximise local utility/quality of life). High inequality creates steep gradients, leading to massive fluxes (migration crises, capital flight) that can destabilize the global system.

## 2. Global Health Index (k)
We apply the UET Health Index globally.
*   High $k$ nations act as "Attractors".
*   Low $k$ nations act as "Repellers".

## 3. Computational Results
The simulation ranks countries by their calculated thermodynamic health ($k$).

The visualization displays the **Top 20 Economies** ranked by $k$, revealing that GDP per capita is not the sole determinant of health—debt ratios and employment (participation) are critical stability factors.

## 4. Conclusion
Reducing global inequality is thermodynamically equivalent to "smoothing the potential surface," reducing the violence of restorative fluxes. Sustainable globalization requires coupled gradients, not steep discontinuities.
