# UET Research Solution: Economic Equilibrium & Volatility

## 1. Theoretical Framework
Economies are Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) minimizing scarcity (maximzing utility). UET maps economic variables to thermodynamic potentials:
*   **Money**: Energy ($E$).
*   **Productivity**: Work capacity ($W$).
*   **Debt**: Entropy/Information deficit ($S$).

The **Economic Health Index (k)** is derived from the Master Equation:
$$ k = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Productivity}}{\text{Debt}}} \times \text{Employment Rate} $$

## 2. Stability Analysis
*   **k ≈ 1.0**: Healthy equilibrium. Growth is backed by productivity.
*   **k < 0.5**: Stagnation. Debt load exceeds productive capacity (High Entropy).
*   **k > 1.5**: Overheating/Bubble. Fictitious capital decoupling from thermodynamic reality.

## 3. Computational Results
The test script analyzes global market indices to classify economies.

The visualization plots **Volatility vs. k-Index**:
*   Stable markets cluster near $k=1$ with low volatility.
*   Fragile markets show high volatility and deviating $k$.

## 4. Conclusion
Financial crashes are "Phase Transitions" where the system sheds excess entropy (debt default) to restore $k$ to sustainable levels. UET provides a predictive metric for these critical points.
