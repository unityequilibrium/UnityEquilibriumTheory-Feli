# Study A: Biology (Life as Recoil Management)
**Method**: UET Complexity
**Status**: Conceptual

### 1. Abstract
Life creates Order ($S$) by exporting Recoil ($R$). High Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indicates a system with high "Processing Capacity" to handle entropy.

### 2. Conclusion
Health is Information Bandwidth.
