# UET Research Solution: Climate forcing & System Stability

## 1. Theoretical Framework
From the perspective of Unity Equilibrium Theory, the Earth's climate is a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system driven by solar flux ($J_{in}$) and radiative cooling ($J_{out}$).

Accululation of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) acts as an impedance factor ($Z$) in the Information Field flux equation:

$$ J_{out} = \frac{\Delta T}{Z_{atm}} $$

As $Z_{atm}$ increases (due to CO2), maintaining the same flux $J_{out}$ requires a higher potentials $\Delta T$. This is **Forced Equilibrium**.

## 2. CO2 & Temperature Correlation
The standard model views this as radiative forcing. UET views it as a shift in the **System Minimum** ($\Omega_{min}$). The system *must* roll down the potential gradient towards the new, hotter minimum.

$$ \Omega_{new} = \Omega_{old} + \alpha \int [CO_2] dt $$

## 3. Computational Results
The simulation tracks the trajectory of the climate system relative to the historic baseline.

*   **Forcing Function**: We plot the acceleration of the system state away from the Holocene equilibrium.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Identify positive feedbacks (ice-albedo) as steepening gradients in the potential surface.

## 4. Conclusion
The "Climate Crisis" is a re-equilibration event. UET predicts that high-impedance transitions (fast CO2 rise) induce turbulence (extreme weather) as the system dissipates excess gradient energy.
