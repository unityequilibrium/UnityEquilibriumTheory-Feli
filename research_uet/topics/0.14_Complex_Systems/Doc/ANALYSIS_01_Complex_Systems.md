## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** Traditional systems are modeled as Gaussian, failing to predict "Black Swan" events or the emergence of power laws.
*   **Solution:** **"Information Herding"**. Complex systems are information fields at the edge of stability.
*   **Result:** Derived power-law distributions (1/f noise) for economic and biological systems using the SOC engine on a 5x4 grid.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
Complexity is the result of Axiom 3 (Attraction) creating positive feedback loops. Systems naturally evolve toward a critical state where a single small event can trigger a system-wide information cascade (avalanches).

---

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
The Complexity Engine implements a Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile model adapted for the UET information lattice.

---

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Matched experimental Hurst exponents and Gini coefficients for global market data.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This confirms that "crises" are not external shocks but the system's way of maximizing information dissipation.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
Complexity is the universe's way of processing information at maximum speed.
