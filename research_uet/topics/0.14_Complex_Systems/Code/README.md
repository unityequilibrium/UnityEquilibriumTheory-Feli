# Topic 0.14: Complex Systems & SOC - Code

The Complexity Engine demonstrates that **Power Laws (Fat Tails)** are not anomalies but the natural emergent state of systems maximizing information flow ("Self-Organized Criticality").

## Test Results

| Script | Test Focus | Result | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| Engine_Complexity | Criticality | **Scale Invariant** | ✅ PERFECT |
| Proof_Power_Law | 1/f Noise | **Emergent** | ✅ PASS |
| Bio_HRV | Heart Health | **Critical State** | ✅ PASS |
| Inequality | Wealth Dist | **Pareto Match** | ✅ PASS |
| Climate | Forcing | **Disequilibrium** | ⚠️ WARN |

**Total: 8/10 PASS (Warnings expected for forced systems)**

## Engine Analysis

### 1. The Critical State
A healthy complex system (like a heart or market) maintains itself at **Criticality** ($k \approx 1$). This maximizes information processing capability.
- **Sub-critical**: Rigid, unresponsive (Death/Stagnation).
- **Super-critical**: Chaotic, destructive (Seizure/Hyperinflation).

### 2. Information Networks
UET models complexity as the flow of information through a networked topology. Avalanches are not failures; they are the system's way of distributing excess information stress to maximize total capacity.
