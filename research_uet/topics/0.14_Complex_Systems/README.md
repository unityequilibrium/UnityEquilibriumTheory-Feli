## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Traditional "Efficient Market" models assume Gaussian (Bell Curve) distributions, vastly underestimating the risk of crashes (Black Swans) and ignoring the connected nature of agents.
- **The Solution:** UET applies **Axiom 3 (Attraction)** and **Axiom 5 (Momentum)** to social physics. Agents (people/companies) act like Information Nodes that gravitate toward established patterns, naturally creating "Herding" and "Power Laws" without needing external shocks.
- **The Result:** We successfully simulate market crashes and wealth inequality (Pareto distribution) as intrinsic properties of the Information Field.

## 2. ⚡ Quick Start

```python
import research_uet as uet
import numpy as np

# [1] Analyze Time Series Entropy
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
complexity = uet.complexity.ComplexityEngine()
metrics = complexity.compute_complexity_metrics(data)

print(f"System Entropy: {metrics['entropy']}")
print(f"Equilibrium Score: {metrics['equilibrium_score']}")
```
