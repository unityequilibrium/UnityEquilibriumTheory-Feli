## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Traditional "Efficient Market" models assume Gaussian (Bell Curve) distributions, vastly underestimating the risk of crashes (Black Swans) and ignoring the connected nature of agents.
- **The Solution:** UET applies **Axiom 3 (Attraction)** and **Axiom 5 (Momentum)** to social physics. Agents (people/companies) act like Information Nodes that gravitate toward established patterns, naturally creating "Herding" and "Power Laws" without needing external shocks.
- **The Result:** We successfully simulate market crashes and wealth inequality (Pareto distribution) as intrinsic properties of the Information Field.
