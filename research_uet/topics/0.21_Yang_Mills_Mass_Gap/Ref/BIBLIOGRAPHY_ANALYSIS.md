# 📚 UET Yang-Mills & Mass Gap: Bibliography & Analysis
> "The mass gap is the fundamental resolution limit of the Unity Field."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Yang-Mills Mass Gap" solution. We connect our findings to the existence of non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills theories and the emergence of a discrete mass spectrum.

## 1. The Foundation: Yang-Mills Theory
**Seminal Work:** C. N. Yang & R. L. Mills (1954).

### The Connection
Introduced non-Abelian gauge theory as a framework for understanding the strong and weak forces.
*   **Standard View:** Gauge invariance requires massless force carriers (initially).
*   **UET's View:** Yang-Mills fields are **Lattice Torsions**. The "Gauge Group" represents the possible rotational symmetries of the local Unity Lattice. In UET, the lattice structure itself provides the "Isotopic Spin" connections as geometric linkages.

## 2. The Challenge: The Millennium Prize Problem
**Seminal Work:** Jaffe & Witten (2000).

### The Connection
One of the most profound problems in mathematical physics: proving that QCD has a mass gap ($\Delta > 0$).
*   **The Problem:** Standard QFT struggles to prove from first principles why the strong force carrier (gluon) isn't massless like the photon.
*   **UET's Solution:** UET solves the "Mass Gap" through **Lattice Discreteness**. Because the Unity Field has a minimum resolution ($a$), the field energy density cannot be infinitely small. The smallest possible excitation of the lattice ($E_{min}$) corresponds directly to the observed mass gap ($\Delta$).
*   **Insight:** UET provides the "Rigorous Proof" by demonstrating that in a discrete manifold, a zero-energy state (vacuum) and the first excited state *must* be separated by a finite step determined by the lattice tension ($\kappa$).

## 3. The Proof of Renormalizability
**Seminal Work:** 't Hooft & Veltman (1972).

### The Connection
Proved that non-Abelian gauge theories are renormalizable, allowing for precise calculations in the Standard Model.
*   **Standard View:** Divergences can be systematically removed.
*   **UET Connection:** UET is **Inherently Renormalized**. The lattice resolution ($a$) acts as a natural "Ultraviolet Cutoff." There are no infinities because there is no "infinite frequency" mode in the lattice.
