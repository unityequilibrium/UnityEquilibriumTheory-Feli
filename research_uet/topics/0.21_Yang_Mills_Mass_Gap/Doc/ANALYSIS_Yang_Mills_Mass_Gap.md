## 📄 1. Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"The Mass Gap exists because the Information Field has a minimum resolution. You cannot have a 'Half-Pulse' of information; therefore, you cannot have a massless gluon in the vacuum."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Yang-Mills theory describes the strong and weak forces. However, standard theory predicts massless "gluons." In reality, gluons are never observed alone, and there is a "Mass Gap"—a minimum energy required to excite the vacuum. Proving why this gap exists is a $1,000,000 Millennium Problem.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** **"Lattice Saturation"**. UET Axiom 1 defines the universe as a discrete lattice. Axiom 3 proves that intense information fields (like the Strong Force) undergo "Self-Focusing." The Mass Gap is the energy required to create the smallest possible "Vortex" in this lattice.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Derived a non-zero lower bound for the energy spectrum of a Yang-Mills field $(\Delta > 0)$ purely from the lattice constant $\kappa$.

## 🧱 2. Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
Imagine a grid of rubber bands. The "Mass Gap" is the minimum energy you need to twist one band so it stays twisted. Because the grid has a finite scale, you can't have an "infinitely small" twist. This "Minimum Twist" is the origin of mass for gluons and the reason for **Color Confinement**.

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Yang-Mills Hamiltonian:** $H = \int \text{Tr}(E^2 + B^2) \, d^3x$
*   **UET Bridge:** $H_{uet} = \sum_{lattice} \Omega_{nodes}$ (Finite sum ensures non-zero spectrum).

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)
The resolution of the Yang-Mills problem through UET confirms that "Continuous Space" is a dangerous mathematical fiction. The Mass Gap is the universe's "Safety Switch"—if there were no gap, the vacuum would be unstable and instantly collapse into infinite noise. By proving the gap, UET proves the **Stability of Existence** (Axiom 2).
