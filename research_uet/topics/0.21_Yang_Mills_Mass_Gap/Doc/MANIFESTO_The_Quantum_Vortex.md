# 🌀 Manifesto: The Origin of Mass (Quantum Vortex Theory)

**Topic:** 0.21 Yang-Mills Mass Gap
**Philosophy:** "Mass is Motion confined in a Knot."

## 1. The Question
Why does a proton have mass? $\approx 99\%$ of its mass comes from the **Binding Energy** of gluons, not the quarks themselves. But gluons are massless. How does "massless energy" become "mass"?

## 2. The UET Hypothesis
Based on **Topic 0.26 (Viscous Universe)**, we know space has density $\rho \sim 10^{-16} kg/m^3$ and viscosity.

*   **PARTICLE = VORTEX.**
    A particle (like a proton/glueball) is a stable **"Whirlpool"** in this cosmic fluid.
    
*   **MASS = INERTIA OF FLOW.**
    The "Mass" is simply the kinetic energy of the fluid trapped in this rotation, resisting change in motion (Inertia).

*   **THE MASS GAP = MINIMUM STARTUP COST.**
    You cannot have a "slow" vortex.
    *   If it spins too slow -> Viscosity stops it (Dissipates).
    *   If it spins fast enough -> It becomes self-sustaining (Soliton).
    *   The **"Mass Gap" ($\Delta > 0$)** is the minimum energy required to create this self-sustaining structure.

## 3. The Research Plan
We will use the **Fluid Engine (0.10)** to simulate a 3D Vortex.
*   **Goal:** Find the "Critical Velocity" where the vortex doesn't die.
*   **Prediction:** This critical energy will match the known Mass Gap ($\approx 100-700$ MeV).
