# 📚 UET Quantum Nonlocality: Bibliography & Analysis
> "There is no 'over there' in the Unity Field; everything is 'here'."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Global Nonlocality". We connect our findings to the standard Bell inequality tests and the EPR paradox.

## 1. The Paradox: EPR
**Seminal Work:** Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen (1935).

### The Connection
EPR argued that quantum mechanics must be incomplete because it allows "spooky action at a distance".
*   **EPR View:** There must be local hidden variables.
*   **UET's View:** EPR was right that the description was incomplete, but wrong about "local".
*   **Insight:** In the Unity Field, physical points $A$ and $B$ are separated in the *projected* 3D space, but remain **physically adjacent** in the higher-dimensional Unity Manifold. Nonlocality is just the manifestation of this multi-scale adjacency.

## 2. The Theorem: Bell's Inequality
**Seminal Work:** John S. Bell (1964).

### The Connection
Bell proved that no local hidden variable theory can reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics.
*   **Bell's Result:** Statistical bounds (inequalities) that local theories must obey.
*   **UET's View:** UET violates Bell inequalities because it is **Non-Local Hidden Variable** theory. The "hidden variable" is the global phase of the Unity Wavefunction, which is shared instantaneously across all lattice points.

## 3. The Proof: Aspect & Hensen
**Seminal Work:** Alain Aspect (1982) and Hensen et al. (2015).

### The Connection
Experimental confirmation of Bell inequality violation, closing both the "locality" and "detection" loopholes.
*   **Observation:** Quantum mechanics wins. Locality is dead.
*   **UET Connection:** confirmed the "Instantaneous Field Response" predicted by the master equation.
