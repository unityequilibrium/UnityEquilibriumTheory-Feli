# 📉 Limitation: Phenomenological Simulation

## The Problem
UET claims that "Entanglement" is a topological "knot" (Shared Address) in the Information Field.
However, our current simulation code does **NOT** simulate this topology directly.

Instead, the `nonlocality_solver.py` explicitly enforces the Quantum Mechanical probability law:
$$ P(\text{anti-correlated}) = \cos^2(\theta_A - \theta_B) $$

## Why is this a limitation?
- **No Emergence:** The Bell violation ($S > 2$) does not *emerge* from the interaction of agents/nodes in the I-field. It is hardcoded.
- **Isomorphism:** While valid as a demonstration that UET *maps* to QM (Isomorphism), it is not a *proof* of the underlying mechanism.

## Honest Admission
The simulation results ($S \approx 2.8$) are labeled as **[PHENOMENOLOGICAL]**. 
We are effectively asking the computer to "act like Quantum Mechanics" rather than building a universe where QM emerges naturally from local rules.
