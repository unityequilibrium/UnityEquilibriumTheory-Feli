# After: UET Double Slit Interpretation

## 1. Problem Definition: Wave-Particle Duality
The central mystery of Quantum Mechanics: How can a single particle interfere with itself?
- **Classical**: Particles go through one slit (No interference).
- **Quantum**: Wavefunction $\Psi$ goes through both (Interference).
- **Measurement Problem**: Observing path destroys interference.

## 2. UET Solution: The Information Pilot Wave
UET derives the Schrödinger Equation from the Information Field dynamics (see `UET_Derivation.md`).
- **Separation**: The particle (Mass/Energy $\rho_E$) is localized. The Information Wave ($\Omega$) is delocalized.
- **Guidance**: The particle surfs on its own Information Field ($\nabla \rho_{info}$). The I-field passes through *both* slits, creating an interference pattern in the potential $\Phi$.
- **Dynamics**: The particle is guided to the bright fringes where Information Density $\rho_{info}$ is maximized (Entropy Minimization).

## 3. Results Analysis

### Interference Pattern

## 4. Conclusion
UET restores Realism. The particle exists at a definite position, but its path is determined by a real, physical Information Field that exhibits wave-like interference. This is mathematically equivalent to Bohmian Mechanics but derived from fundamental laws of information entropy.
