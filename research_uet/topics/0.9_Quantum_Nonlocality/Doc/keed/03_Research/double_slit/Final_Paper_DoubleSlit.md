# Study B: Double Slit Experiment
**Method**: UET Processing Path
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
Particles act as waves when unobserved. UET: "Unobserved" means "Address Not Resolved". The system processes all possible paths (Wave) until an I/O request (Observation) forces a specific address (Particle).

### 2. Result
Collapse is just "Address Resolution".
