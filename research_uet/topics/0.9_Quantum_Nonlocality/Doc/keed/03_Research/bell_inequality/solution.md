# After: UET Bell Non-Locality

## 1. Problem Definition: The EPR Paradox
Quantum Mechanics (QM) predicts instantaneous correlation between entangled particles, violating Local Realism (Bell, 1964).
Experiments (Aspect 1982, Hensen 2015) confirm QM with $S_{exp} \approx 2.42 > 2.0$.
- **Standard Model**: Accepts non-locality as a fundamental axiom without mechanism ("Spooky Action").
- **UET Goal**: Explain *how* information travels instantaneously without violating causality.

## 2. UET Solution: Topological Information Knots
In UET, particles are not point-like objects but topological defects (knots) in the Vacuum Information Field ($I$).
- **Entanglement**: Two particles ($A$ and $B$) share a single, continuous topological winding number $\Omega_{AB}$.
- **Mechanism**: They are part of the *same* geometric structure in the vacuum lattice. Measuring $A$ unties the knot, which instantly updates the geometry at $B$ because the knot itself is non-local.
- **Speed**: The "update" is a phase change in the vacuum geometry, which is instantaneous (or $c_{info} \gg c$), but cannot carry energy (matter) faster than $c$.

*Fig 1: Bell Correlation. UET (Blue) matches Quantum Mechanics, violating the Classical Limit (Red). Experimental points (Green) confirm this violation.*

## 4. Conclusion
UET reproduces Quantum Non-locality naturally through the topology of the Information Field. "Spooky action" is replaced by "Topological Connectivity".
