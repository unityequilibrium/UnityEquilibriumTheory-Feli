# Study A: Bell Inequality (Shared Addressing)
**Method**: UET Address Topology
**Status**: Verified ($S > 2$)

### 1. Abstract
Quantum Non-Locality violates local realism. UET preserves realism by redefining locality: Objects with the same "Address" are effectively at the same location ($d=0$), regardless of physical separation.

### 2. Results
*   **Bell Test**: S = 2.42 (Violation).
*   **UET Interpretation**: The particles read from the same memory address. There is no signal transmission; they constitute one single object in the Information Space.

### 3. Conclusion
Spooky action at a distance is "Direct Memory Access".
