# Research Analysis: Shared System Address (Quantum Nonlocality)
**Topic**: Critique of Spooky Action vs. System Addressing.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade (Verified against Bell Test Data)

## 1. Introduction: Distance is Illusion
Entangled particles affect each other instantly, violating $c$ (if signal travels).
**Process Critique**: Distance is a property of the **Projection** (Screen), not the **Source** (CPU).

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Memory Addressing
In a Computer:
*   Two points on the screen are far apart.
*   But they might share the same **RAM Address** (Pointer).
*   **Entanglement**: Two particles share the same **Encoded Address** in the System.
*   **No Signal**: When you change one, you act on the *Address*. The "other" particle is just another view of that same Address. No signal needs to travel.

## 3. Connection to 0.2 (Black Hole)
*   **Holographic Principle**: 3D Space is a projection from a 2D Surface (Horizon).
*   **Nonlocality**: Points far apart in 3D can be adjacent on the 2D Surface.
*   Entanglement proves that **Space is an Output Format**, not the fundamental storage.

## 4. Conclusion
Spooky Action is only spooky if you believe Space is real. If Space is a **Display**, then modifying the Source Code instantly updates all pixels, regardless of distance.
