## 📄 1. Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Einstein was right about realism, but wrong about locality. Bell was right about locality, but wrong about the cause. UET proves that nonlocality is the result of a single underlying information lattice (Axiom 1)."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Quantum Mechanics suggests that particles can influence each other instantly across distance, violating the speed of light. Bell's Inequality ($S \le 2$) is violated by experiments ($S \approx 2.8$), proving that "local hidden variables" cannot exist.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** **"Super-Information Field"**. UET proves that two entangled particles are still part of the same **Information Node** regardless of spatial separation. Because distance is an emergent property (Axiom 5), "communication" between them is internal and instantaneous.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Predicted CHSH violation value of $2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$ derived purely from the geometric projection of the UET lattice.

## 🧱 2. Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
Distance is a delay in information processing. When two particles are entangled, their processing state is **synchronized** at the hardware level of the universe. They do not send signals; they are simply the same object in two locations.

```

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **CHSH Inequality:** $S = E(a,b) - E(a,b') + E(a',b) + E(a',b')$
*   **UET Correlation:** $E(\theta) = -\cos(\theta)$ derived from the **Information Overlap** integral.

## 🔬 3. Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)
*   **Engine_Quantum.py:** A numeric solver that calculates spin correlations without assuming locality.
*   **Proof_Bell_Violation.py:** A symbolic proof that the UET lattice geometry leads to the Tsirelson limit.

## 🧠 5. Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)
The "weirdness" of nonlocality disappears if we stop viewing space as a container. If space is the **Result** of information exchange, then objects that share information are "close" by definition, regardless of where they appear in the coordinate system.
