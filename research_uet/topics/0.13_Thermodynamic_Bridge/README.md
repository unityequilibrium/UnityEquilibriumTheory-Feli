## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Thermodynamics deals with heat and work, while Information Theory deals with bits and bandwidth. They seem separate, yet Landauer's Principle suggests a deep link ($E \ge k_B T \ln 2$) that standard physics struggles to derive from first principles.
- **The Solution:** UET asserts that **"Information is Physical."** By defining Entropy as the "Uncertainty of the Information Manifold" (Axiom 1 & 2), we mathematically derive the Laws of Thermodynamics as emergent properties of Information conservation and flow.
- **The Result:** We accurately predict the minimum energy required to erase a bit (Landauer Limit) without needing empirical fitting.
