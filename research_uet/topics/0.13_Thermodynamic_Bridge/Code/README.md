# Topic 0.13: Thermodynamic Bridge - Code

The Thermodynamic Engine bridges **Information Theory (Shannon)** and **Macro-Thermodynamics (Boltzmann)**, proving that the Second Law is an emergent property of Information Mixing.

### 01_Engine
- **`Engine_Thermodynamics.py`**: The UET Thermo Engine. Simulates bit exchange between two systems to derive Temperature ($1/T = \partial S/\partial E$) and Equilibrium.

### 02_Proof
- **`Proof_Entropy_Max.py`**: A rigorous proof that information mixing always leads to maximized entropy (The Second Law).

### 03_Research
- **`Research_Landauer.py`**: Validates the energy cost of erasing a bit ($k_B T \ln 2$).
- **`Research_Real_Data_Validation.py`**: **Critical Validation**: Checks UET predictions against Berut (2012), LIGO, and EHT data.
- **`Research_Thermodynamic_Bridge.py`**: Integration script connecting all components.

## Engine Analysis

### 1. Information Temperature
Temperature is derived purely from statistics: $1/T = \partial S / \partial E$. This means "Hot" simply means "Adding energy buys very little entropy", while "Cold" means "Adding energy buys a lot of entropy". Energy flows from Hot to Cold to maximize total entropy purchase.

### 2. Emergent Gravity
By extending this logic to the Information Field itself, Jacobson (1995) and UET show that **Gravity is the Entropic Force** driving the universe toward maximum information capacity (Holographic Principle).
