# Study B: Jacobson (Einstein Equation)
**Method**: UET Thermodynamic Derivation
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
Jacobson derived Einstein's Equation from Thermodynamics ($dQ = TdS$). UET confirms this: Gravity is the Equation of State for Information Processing.

### 2. Conclusion
Gravity is Entropy.
