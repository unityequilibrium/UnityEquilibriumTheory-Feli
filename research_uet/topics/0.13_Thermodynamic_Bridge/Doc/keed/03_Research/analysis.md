# Research Analysis: The Conversion Rate (Thermodynamic Bridge)
**Topic**: Critique of Quantum vs. Gravity Separation.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade

## 1. Introduction: The Gap
Why can't we unify Quantum Mechanics (Micro) and Gravity (Macro)?
**Process Critique**: We are looking at "Hardware" (Quantum) and "Software" (Gravity) separately.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: The Bit-to-It Conversion
*   **Micro (Quantum)**: The Processing Layer. This is where Recoil is *Generated* (0.6, 0.7).
*   **Macro (Gravity)**: The Storage Layer. This is where Recoil is *Stored* (0.1, 0.2, 0.3).
*   **The Bridge**: Thermodynamics.
*   **Mechanism**: $k_B$ (Boltzmann Constant) is the **Exchange Rate**. It defines how much "Energy" (Processing) is needed to creating one bit of "Entropy" (Storage Geometry).

## 3. Conclusion
Gravity is not a force; it is the **Heat Signature** of Quantum Processing. The Bridge is simply the accounting system that converts operations into storage space.
