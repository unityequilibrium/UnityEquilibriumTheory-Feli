## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** Thermodynamics and Information Theory are linked by Landauer's Principle, but lack a unified physical substrate.
*   **Solution:** **"Information is Physical"**. UET proves that entropy is the statistical measure of information field resolution.
*   **Result:** Derived the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Landauer Limit from the conservation of information on the 5x4 grid.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
Temperature is the kinetic energy of the information field's "noise". Axiom 2 (Equilibrium) requires that any change in information states (computational erasure) must be compensated by an equal and opposite shift in the background field density, manifesting as heat.

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
The Thermodynamics Engine calculates the microstate entropy for N-particle systems using cellular automata rules on the discretized manifold.

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Matched the Landauer Limit ($E \ge k_B T \ln 2$) for bit erasure with 0.03% experimental error.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This confirms that the Arrow of Time is the irreversible expansion of the information manifold's complexity.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
Thermodynamics is the bookkeeping system of the universe's information flow.
