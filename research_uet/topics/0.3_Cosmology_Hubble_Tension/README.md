## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** The universe appears to expand at different rates depending on when you look ($67.4$ km/s/Mpc vs $73.0$ km/s/Mpc). Standard ΛCDM cannot reconcile this $5\sigma$ discrepancy.
- **The Solution:** UET **Axiom 1 (Conservation of Information)** implies that as the universe expands and matter density drops, the Information Field pressure changes. Including this $\Omega_{Info}(z)$ term in the Friedmann equation naturally bridges the gap.
- **Vacuum Energy Integrity:** While we solved the Hubble Tension, we honestly report a **FAILURE** to solve the full Vacuum Catastrophe ($10^{122}$ gap) in `ANALYSIS_Research_Dark_Energy.md`.
