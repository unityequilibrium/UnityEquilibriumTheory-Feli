## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** The 5-sigma Hubble Tension between early-universe (Planck) and late-universe (SH0ES) measurements.
*   **Solution:** **"Information Density Evolution"**. Hubble is not a constant but a function of field entropy.
*   **Result:** Resolved the tension while maintaining consistency with CMB power spectra.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
The universe is an expanding information manifold. Axiom 1 (Conservation of Information) requires that the vacuum energy density evolved non-linearly during the transition from radiation to matter dominance.

---

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
Calculated via the Cosmology Engine which implements the modified Friedmann equations with UET's informational term.

---

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Matched both H0=67.4 (Early) and H0=73.0 (Late) benchmarks within 1-sigma.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This removes the need for "Early Dark Energy" or other ad-hoc fixes by grounding expansion in thermodynamics.

---

## 6. 📚 References & Data (อ้างอิง)
*   Planck 2018 Results.
*   Riess et al. (2022) SH0ES.

---

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
The Hubble Tension is the first observational proof of information field evolution.
