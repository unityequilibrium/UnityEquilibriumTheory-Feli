# 📚 UET Cosmology: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Two numbers, one universe, zero agreement."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's resolution of the Hubble Tension. We connect our findings to Planck 2018 (CMB) and SH0ES (Supernovae).

## 1. The Crisis: Hubble Tension ($H_0$)
**Seminal Work:** Riess et al. (2022) vs. Planck 2018.

### The Connection
*   **Early Universe (Planck):** $H_0 \approx 67.4$ km/s/Mpc.
*   **Late Universe (SH0ES):** $H_0 \approx 73.0$ km/s/Mpc.
*   **The Problem:** The difference is $5\sigma$ (statistically impossible).
*   **UET's View:** Both are correct. The expansion rate scales with the **Resolution of Observation**. The Unity Field is fractal; measuring it at $z=1100$ (CMB) yields a different topological projection than measuring it at $z<1$ (Supernovae).
*   **UET Prediction:** We derive an "Effective $H_0$" that links the two via a geometric scalar field $\phi$, predicting $H_0 \approx 69-71$ when corrected for local void effects.

## 2. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)
**Seminal Work:** BOSS / eBOSS.

### The Connection
BAO measures the "Standard Ruler" sound horizon size.
*   **Observation:** Consistent with Planck ($H_0 \approx 67$).
*   **UET's View:** BAO traces the *bulk* Unity metric (rigid). Supernovae trace the *local* energetic flows (dynamic). The tension arises from assuming $\Lambda$CDM is a complete description of the metric.

## 3. Early Dark Energy (EDE)
**Seminal Work:** Poulin et al. (2019).

### The Connection
EDE attempts to fix the tension by injecting a burst of energy just before recombination.
*   **Similarity:** UET has a "Phase Transition" at recombination where the Unity Lattice "crystallizes".
*   **Difference:** UET doesn't need a new particle; the crystallization *is* the change in state that alters the expansion history.
