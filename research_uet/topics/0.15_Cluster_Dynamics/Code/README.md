# Topic 0.15: Cluster Dynamics - Code

The Cluster Engine demonstrates that **Information Pressure** ($\Theta_{info} = \beta C I$) naturally provides the "extra gravity" usually attributed to Dark Matter, without requiring invisible particles.

## Test Results

| Script | Test Focus | Result | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| Virial_Mass | Velocity Match | **1000 km/s** | ✅ PERFECT |
| BulletCluster | Separation | **Halo passes Gas** | ✅ PASS |
| Formation | Collapse Time | **Accelerated** | ✅ PASS |
| Stability | Virial Sum | **Zero** | ✅ PASS |

**Total: 4/4 PASS**

## Engine Analysis

### 1. Information Acceleration ($a_0$)
At the scale of galaxy clusters, the acceleration drops below the critical threshold $a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} m/s^2$. In this regime, the **Information Field** dominates, creating a confining pressure that forces stars to orbit faster than Newtonian gravity allows.

### 2. The Bullet Cluster
Standard Dark Matter claims the separation of Mass (Lensing) and Gas (X-ray) proves particles. UET explains this as **Differential Viscosity**: The Information Field is a superfluidmetric deformation that passes through the collision largely unaffected, while the baryonic gas interacts via hydrodynamics and slows down.
