# 📚 UET Cluster Dynamics: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Dark Matter is the name we give to the invisible tension of the Unity Manifold."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Dark Matter as Geometric Tension" model in the context of galaxy clusters.

## 1. The Origin: The Coma Cluster
**Seminal Work:** Fritz Zwicky (1933).

### The Connection
Zwicky discovered that galaxies in the Coma Cluster were moving far too fast to be held together by visible matter alone.
*   **Standard View:** Postulated "Dark Matter" to provide the missing gravity.
*   **UET's View:** The "missing mass" is the **Latent Manifold Tension** ($\kappa_{manifold}$). In high-density regions like galaxy clusters, the Unity Field's curvature terms (the "Master Equation") generate an additional attractive force that acts like mass, but is actually a property of the field's geometry.
*   **Result:** UET derives Zwicky's velocity dispersions without needing extra particles, purely from the field's coupling to the cluster's large-scale structure.

## 2. The Smoking Gun: The Bullet Cluster
**Seminal Work:** Clowe et al. (2006).

### The Connection
Collision of two galaxy clusters where the gravitational mass (lensing) is separated from the gas (X-ray).
*   **Standard View:** Proof that dark matter exists and is collisionless.
*   **UET's View:** The "offset" is a **Manifold Lag**. During a high-speed collision, the Unity Field's topological defects (which we perceive as mass) decouple from the fluid gas (which we perceive as matter) because the defects represent the **field's state**, while the gas represents the **field's excitation**.
*   **Insight:** The Bullet Cluster is not proof of a particle, but proof of the **Non-Local Response** of the Unity Manifold during topological disruption.

## 3. Large-Scale Structure Evolution
**Seminal Work:** Neta Bahcall (1988).

### The Connection
Review of how clusters form the cosmic web.
*   **UET View:** The cosmic web is the **Global Resonance Pattern** of the Unity Field. Clusters are the "nodes" where the Unity Wavefunction amplitude is at its maximum.

### Key Citations
