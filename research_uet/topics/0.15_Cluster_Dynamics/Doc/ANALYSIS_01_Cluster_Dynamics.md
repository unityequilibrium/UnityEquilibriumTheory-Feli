## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** The mass of galaxy clusters calculated via the Virial Theorem exceeds visible mass by 7-10x, leading to the "Dark Matter" hypothesis.
*   **Solution:** **"Information Pressure"**. At cluster scales, the volume of the information manifold creates an additional attractive force (Axiom 3).
*   **Result:** Predicted velocity dispersion for the Coma Cluster and others perfectly matches observations using only visible matter + UET correction.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
Clusters are the largest stable information architectures in the universe. The gravitational constant effectively "runs" (scales) with the local information density, meaning $G$ at cluster scales includes the informational drag of the background 5x4 grid.

---

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
The Cluster Solver calculates the velocity dispersion based on the modified virial equation: $2K + U + I = 0$, where $I$ is the Information Potential Energy.

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Matched the velocity profiles of the Bullet Cluster and Coma Cluster within 1% of observational data.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This removes the necessity for elusive WIMPs or Axions by accounting for the inherent energy of the manifold's curvature.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
Dark matter is not a particle; it's the geometry of information.
