# 🔬 ANALYSIS: 0.11 Phase Transitions (MFT Solver)

> **File/Script:** `research_uet/topics/0.11_Phase_Transitions/Code/04_Competitor/phase_solver.py`
> **Role:** Competitor (Mean Field Theory)
> **Status:** ✅ BENCHMARK

## 1. 📄 Executive Summary
Uses Mean Field Theory approximation $M = \tanh(\beta J M)$ which overestimates $T_c$. Used to show UET's superiority (which captures fluctuations).
