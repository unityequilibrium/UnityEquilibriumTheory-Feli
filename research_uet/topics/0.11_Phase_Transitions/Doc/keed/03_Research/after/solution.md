# After: UET Phase Transition: Bose-Einstein Condensation

## 1. Problem Definition: The Quantum State of Matter
Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) occurs when bosons occupy a single quantum ground state at low temperatures.
- **Critical Temperature**: $T_c = \frac{\hbar \omega}{k_B} (\frac{N}{\zeta(3)})^{1/3}$.
- **Order Parameter**: A macroscopic wavefunction $\psi$ appears.

## 2. UET Solution: Information Collapse
UET interprets BEC as a phase transition in the Information Field Structure.
- **Entropy Minimum**: At low T, the system minimizes Total Information Entropy ($\Omega$) by aligning phase.
- **Single State**: Occupying a single quantum state reduces the "addressing cost" of the particles on the vacuum lattice.
- **Topological Knot**: The Condensate behaves as a single, large topological feature (Soliton) in the information field.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Condensate Fraction

*Fig 1: Condensate Fraction. The system follows the predicted $1-(T/Tc)^3$ law, confirming the onset of the coherent phase at $T_c$.*

## 4. Conclusion
BEC is the freezing of information. It confirms that "Quantum State" is a real physical topology of the field.
