# Study A: Bose-Einstein Condensate (Address Compression)
**Method**: UET State Merging
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
BEC occurs when atoms merge into a single quantum state. UET calls this "Address Compression". The system reduces its total address space to 1, effectively becoming a single super-atom.

### 2. Results
*   **Critical Temp**: The point where thermal noise < cost of maintaining separate addresses.

### 3. Conclusion
BEC is the "Zip File" of matter.
