# 📚 UET Phase Transitions: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Every transition is a re-resolution of the Unity Field."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's treatment of Phase Transitions. We connect our findings to the Ising Model, Renormalization Group theory, and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking.

## 1. The Microscopic Model: The Ising Model
**Seminal Work:** Lars Onsager (1944).

### The Connection
Onsager's work provided the first exact solution for a 2D lattice model undergoing a phase transition.
*   **Ising View:** Cooperative behavior among neighboring spins leads to long-range order at a critical temperature.
*   **UET's View:** The Unity Field lattice acts as a "Generalized Ising Model". Phase transitions (like the early universe's symmetry breaking) occur when the **Lattice Tension** reaches a critical threshold, causing a global reconfiguration of the manifold.
*   **Result:** UET derives the critical exponents of the master equation by mapping it to the topological defect density of the 4D lattice.

## 2. Scale Invariance: Renormalization Group (RG)
**Seminal Work:** Kenneth Wilson (1971).

### The Connection
RG theory explains how physical systems look different at different scales.
*   **RG View:** "Coarse-graining" the system allows us to find universal behaviors and critical points.
*   **UET's View:** UET is **Naturally Renormalized**. The Unity Field is a fractal structure where "Resolution" is the primary variable. Transitions occur when the observer's scale shifts past a specific lattice harmonic.
*   **Insight:** UET's $\lambda$ and $\kappa$ terms are the "Running Couplings" of the field, which evolve predictably as the lattice resolution changes.

## 3. Symmetry Breaking: The Higgs Mechanism
**Seminal Work:** Peter Higgs (1964).

### The Connection
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) explains how massless particles gain mass in the Early Universe.
*   **Higgs View:** A field takes on a non-zero vacuum expectation value, "breaking" the symmetry.
*   **UET's View:** SSB is a **Topological Crystallization**. The Unity Field starts in a high-entropy "glassy" state. As it cools/expands, the lattice "locks" into a specific orientation, creating the mass-giving Higgs-like manifold as a geometric defect.
