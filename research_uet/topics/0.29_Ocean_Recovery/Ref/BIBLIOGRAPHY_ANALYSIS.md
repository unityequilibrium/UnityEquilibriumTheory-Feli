# 📚 Bibliography Analysis: Topic 0.29 Ocean Recovery

## 1. NOAA Coral Reef Watch (Dataset)
*   **Why Method Matters:** NOAA combines Satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) with historical baselines to define "Degree Heating Weeks" (DHW). This is the global gold standard for predicting bleaching.
*   **UET Application:** We use this data to identify "High Priority Zones" for deployment. Our structure is only deployed where DHW > 4.

## 2. Huang et al. (2012): Graphene Thermal Conductivity
*   **Key Finding:** Adding Graphene at low loading (1-5%) significantly boosts thermal conductivity of polymer matrices.
*   **UET Application:** Justifies our engineering spec of 20 W/mK for the Geopolymer composite. Without this reference, our cooling assertion would be speculative.

## 3. Hassan et al. (2019): Geopolymer Durability
*   **Key Finding:** Geopolymer concrete exhibits superior resistance to sulfate and chloride attack compared to OPC.
*   **UET Application:** Supports our claim that the structure can last >100 years in seawater ("Zero Waste").

## 4. Costanza et al. (2014): Ecosystem Services
*   **Key Finding:** Coral Reefs provide ~$350,000/ha/year in ecosystem services (adjusted for inflation/scope).
*   **UET Application:** Used as the basis for our Economic ROI calculation ($80,000 conservative estimate) to prove superiority over Reforestation.
