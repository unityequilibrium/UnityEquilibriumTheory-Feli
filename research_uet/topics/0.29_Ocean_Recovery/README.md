## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Ocean acidification and microplastic pollution are accelerating. Standard solutions are expensive, industrial-only, and not scalable to global needs.
- **The Solution:** UET proposes **Graphene from Carbon Waste** to create an "Ocean Shield." By using acoustic resonance and perovskite materials, we achieve 100x cost reduction.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** All materials are derived from waste streams (agricultural carbon), not mined or synthesized from scratch.
