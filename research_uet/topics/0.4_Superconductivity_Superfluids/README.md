## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Standard BCS theory relies on phonon vibrations and fails to explain high-temperature superconductors or the behavior of heavy elements (like Pb, Hg) where relativistic effects matter.
- **The Solution:** UET views superconductivity as a phase transition where the Information Field becomes smooth (Coherent). By adding a **Relativistic Correction** $(1 + 1.5(Z/137)^2)$ to the engine, we accurately models the $T_c$ of heavy elements.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** No material-specific "fudge factors" were used; physics is derived from atomic number (Z) and lattice geometry.
