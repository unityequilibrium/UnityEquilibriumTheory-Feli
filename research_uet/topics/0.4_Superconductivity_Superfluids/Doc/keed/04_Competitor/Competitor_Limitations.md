# Limitation: The Mystery of Zero Resistance

## 1. The Classical Limit
In classical physics (Drude model), resistance $R$ arises from electrons scattering off lattice ions and defects. Even at $T=0$, impurities should cause residual resistance.
**Superconductivity** challenges this: $R=0$ exactly.

## 2. The BCS Gap (Limitation)
BCS Theory (1957) explains conventional superconductivity using Cooper Pairs and an Energy Gap ($\Delta$).
However, standard BCS:
1.  **Fails for High-Tc:** Cannot explain cuprates ($T_c > 30K$).
2.  **Weak on Strong Coupling:** Requires complex corrections (Eliashberg theory) for materials like Lead (Pb) or Mercury (Hg).
3.  **No Topological Insight:** Treats phase coherence as a secondary quantum effect, not a fundamental topological lock.

## 3. The Necessity
We need a framework that explains "Zero Resistance" not just as a lack of scattering, but as a **Topological Protection** of the information state (Phase Locking).
