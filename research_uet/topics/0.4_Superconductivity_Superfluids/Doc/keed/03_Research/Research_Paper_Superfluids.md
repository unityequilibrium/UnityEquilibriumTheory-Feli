# Study B: Superfluidity (Zero Viscosity)
**Method**: UET Vacuum Interaction
**Status**: Conceptual Pass

### 1. Abstract
Superfluid Helium flows without friction. UET explains this: The fluid atoms lock into a single Quantum Object (One Address).

### 2. Analysis
*   **Viscosity**: In UET, viscosity is the "Information Drag" against the vacuum.
*   **Superfluid**: The entire fluid acts as one update unit. The vacuum cannot "grip" individual atoms. Drag $\to 0$.

### 3. Conclusion
Superfluidity confirms "Address Coherence" reduces physical drag.
