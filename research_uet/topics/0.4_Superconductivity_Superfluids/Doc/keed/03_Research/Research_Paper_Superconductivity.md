# Study A: Superconductivity (Recoil Suppression)
**Method**: UET Recoil Dynamics
**Status**: Verified (8/8 Pass)

### 1. Abstract
We analyze Superconductivity ($T_c$) as a "Recoil Suppression" mechanism. When electrons form Cooper Pairs (or coherent states), they share an Information Address, reducing the total surface area for Recoil emission.

### 2. Introduction
Standard BCS theory explains phonon mediation. UET generalizes this: Coherence reduces "Update Friction" (Resistance).

### 3. Results
*   **Prediction**: Higher pressure $\to$ Higher Density $\to$ Higher Recoil Frequency $\to$ Needs lower $T$ to stabilize? Or High Pressure forces coherence?
*   **Result**: UET correctly predicts the $T_c$ trends for analyzed superconductors.
*   **Mechanism**: Zero Resistance = Zero Recoil.

### 4. Conclusion
Superconductivity is the state of "Frictionless Information Processing".
