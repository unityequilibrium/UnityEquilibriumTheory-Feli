## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Modern surfaces (windows, fridge doors) are passive. Turning them into active displays requires toxic materials, external power, and rare-earth mining.
- **Goal 1: Zero-Mining Materials.** Replacing Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and Copper with Graphene (from agricultural waste) and Perovskite (from recycled sources).
- **Goal 2: Zero-Waste Manufacturing.** Implementing "Urban Mining" and closed-loop systems to prevent toxic runoff into rivers.
- **Goal 3: Geometric Doping.** Using UET's Axiom 3 (Information Trap) to create "virtual doping" in chips, eliminating the need for heavy metal dopants.
 and projection capabilities.
- **Zero-Mining Law:** High-purity Perovskite is "grown" from simple chemical precursors (Mahidol Style), not mined, using Acoustic Resonance to align the lattice.
