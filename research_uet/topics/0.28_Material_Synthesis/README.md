## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Mass-producing Graphene for holograms (Topic 0.27) is impossible with current CVD because random thermal atoms create defects (grain boundaries). It's too slow and yields "dirty" carbon.
- **The Solution:** UET proposes **"Resonant Manufacturing"**. By applying a standing wave field matching the Carbon lattice frequency, atoms are "surfed" into their correct positions.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** The force required is derived from the Boltzmann energy barrier ($k_B T$), ensuring the guidance signal is just strong enough to overcome noise.
