# 📚 UET Biophysics: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Life is not a violation of the laws of physics; it is the most complex expression of them."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Biophysics & Origin of Life" model. We connect our findings to the thermodynamic, informational, and energetic requirements of living systems.

## 1. The Foundation: Negative Entropy
**Seminal Work:** *What is Life?* (1944) by Erwin Schrödinger.

### The Connection
Schrödinger proposed that life maintains its high degree of order by exporting entropy (feeding on "Negentropy").
*   **Schrödinger's View:** Life extracts order from the environment.
*   **UET's View:** Life is a **Unity Field Phase Compression**. The "order" Schrödinger observed is the result of the master equation's ability to maintain high-density information patterns (Coherence) against the lattice vibration (Heat).

## 2. The Mechanism: Dissipative Adaptation
**Seminal Work:** Jeremy England (2013).

### The Connection
England proposes that matter reorganizes to dissipate energy more efficiently.
*   **England's View:** Replication and adaptation are thermodynamic inevitabilities.
*   **UET's View:** This is the **Master Equation's Self-Correction**. The field naturally moves toward configurations that minimize "Manifold Tension" across scales. Life is the highest-bandwidth dissipation mechanism the lattice can support.

## 3. The Origin: Bio-Energetics & Vents
**Seminal Work:** Lane & Martin (2010).

### The Connection
The theory that life began in alkaline hydrothermal vents, using proton gradients as the primary energy source.
*   **Lane's View:** The "Bio-energetic Gap": Prokaryotes are constrained by the surface area of their membranes.
*   **UET Connection:** Proton gradients are **Local Lattice Potentials**. The "Origin of Life" is the moment the Unity Field's local potential reached a threshold where **Auto-catalytic Feedback Loops** could be sustained by the latent field energy.

## 4. The Mind: Free Energy Principle
**Seminal Work:** Karl Friston (2010).

### The Connection
Minimizing "Surprise" or "Variational Free Energy" as the driver of biological behavior.
*   **Friston's View:** Survival is the minimization of sensory entropy.
*   **UET's View:** Information Processing is **Lattice Phase Alignment**. Biological intelligence is the field's attempt to predict its own future states to maintain peak resonance efficiency.
