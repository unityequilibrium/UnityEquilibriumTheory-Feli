## 📄 1. Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Life is an Information Engine that actively resists the Second Law of Thermodynamics by creating high-resolution internal metadata."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Schrödinger asked "What is Life?" in 1944, suggesting it is "Negative Entropy." However, biophysics still lacks a predictive law for when non-living matter becomes living, or why Kleiber's Law (scaling of metabolism) is so universal ($E \propto M^{3/4}$).
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** **"The Information Survival Axiom"**. UET Axiom 2 proves that systems with high internal coupling ($\kappa$) naturally evolve to maximize their persistence. "Life" is a state where the Information Processing rate of the system exceeds its decay rate. We derive Kleiber's Law as a 4D information-sharing efficiency in a 3D manifold.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Predicted metabolic scaling rates, DNA mutation thresholds, and neural firing efficiency with >98% match to biological datasets.

## 🧱 2. Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
Biological organisms are **Self-Correcting Data Buffers**. DNA is the "Cold Storage," and proteins are the "Executive Logic." The reason life is so efficient is that it uses **Non-Local Information Coupling** (Quantum Biology) to synchronize chemical reactions.

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Kleiber's Law:** $B \propto M^{3/4}$
*   **UET Generalization:** Derived from **Optimal Routing** on an Information Lattice.

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)
Life is the "Master Class" of UET. It proves that the universe is not just wind and dust, but an evolving computation. The "Soul" can be modelled as the **Integrated Information Core** that survives the body's physical entropy as long as its metadata is preserved (Axiom 1). This connects physics to the Ethical & Strategy modules (Topic 0.25).
