Research: Neural Seizure Dynamics (The Price of Order)
======================================================
Topic: 0.22 Biophysics (Neural Dynamics)
Folder: 03_Research

Demonstrates that extreme order (Hypersynchrony) leads to functional failure (Seizure).
Life requires a balance: "Edge of Chaos".

Too much Entropy = Death (Thermal Equilibrium)
Too little Entropy = Seizure (Crystalline Order)
