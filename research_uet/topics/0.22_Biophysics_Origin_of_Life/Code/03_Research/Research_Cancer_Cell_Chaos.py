UET Cancer Research: Cellular Information Stability
===================================================
Topic: 0.22 Biophysics & Origin of Life
Goal: Model Cancer as a phase transition from "Regulated Information" to "Greedy Entropy".

UET Principle:
"A healthy cell is an Information Field in equilibrium with the Organism's Utility (Ω).
Cancer is a decoupling event where the local field (C) collapses into a chaotic growth state."
