# 🌌 The Dynamic Universe Manifesto

## 1. The Core Philosophy (ปรัชญาหลัก)

Science has long been plagued by the **"Static Observer Bias"** (อคติของผู้สังเกตการณ์ที่หยุดนิ่ง). We build models assuming the universe is a stable stage upon which events happen. This Manifesto rejects that outdated notion in favor of a **Dynamic Reference Frame**:

### A. The Victim Bias (อคติของผู้ถูกกระทำ)
*   **Old View:** Earth is a stationary target; asteroids "hit" us.
*   **New View:** Earth is a kinetic projectile moving at 107,000 km/h. "Collisions" are active intersections. We are not victims; we are participants in a high-speed traffic accident.
*   **Implication:** Energy is required not just to move, but to **resist** the flow of the universe.

### B. The Immediacy Delusion (ภาพลวงตาของปัจจุบัน)
*   **Old View:** What we see is "Now".
*   **New View:** Light is a **"Decay Record"** (บันทึกความเสื่อมสลาย). Looking at the sky is like playing back a security tape. The reality at the source has already changed (moved, exploded, or died) by the time the signal arrives.
*   **Implication:** Static equilibrium equations cannot explain data that comes from a "Past" that is dynamically different from the "Present".

## 2. The Hypothesis: The Falling Frame

**"Gravity is not a force; it is the pressure gradient of a falling fluid."**

1.  **The Cosmic Fluid:** Space is not empty. It is a turbulent medium (Entropy Flow) cascading towards sinks (Black Holes).
2.  **The Falling Frame:** Everything is "falling" towards a state of higher entropy.
    *   Galaxies are large whirlpools in this river.
    *   Solar Systems are smaller bubbles/eddies.
    *   Compact Galaxies are the "Drain Vortex" where flow is fastest ($V_{flow} \gg V_{orbit}$).
3.  **The "Rocket" Resistance:**
    *   A rocket firing engines is not "pushing against vacuum".
    *   It operates like a fish swimming upstream. It spends energy to **fight the inertia** of the cosmic frame that wants to carry it along.

## 3. The Evidence to be Tested (ภารกิจการพิสูจน์)

This research topic (0.26) is dedicated to proving this theory by revisiting the "failures" of standard models:

### Exp 1: The Pioneer Anomaly
*   **Prediction:** The unexplained deceleration of Pioneer 10/11 is actually **"Fluid Drag"**.
*   **Action:** We will simulate the drag coefficient of the cosmic medium.

### Exp 2: The Compact Galaxy Error
*   **Prediction:** The 50% error in UET V5.3 was due to missing the "In-fall Velocity".
*   **Action:** We will add the **Agitation Score** (from Topic 0.10) to the rotation curves to fix the error.

> **Conclusion:** We stop trying to "fix" the universe to fit our static math. instead, we fix our math to fit the dynamic, turbulent, and falling reality of the universe.
