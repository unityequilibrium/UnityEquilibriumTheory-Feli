# 📚 Bibliography Analysis: Cosmic Dynamic Frame

## Why these papers matter to UET:

### 1. **Laniakea Supercluster (Tully et al.)**
   - **Relevance:** Visualizes the 'Cosmic Flow' lines. Matches UET's 'River of Space' concept.
   - **Use Case:** Validate `Proof_Toroidal_Cycle.py` flow vectors against real Laniakea data.

### 2. **Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (Penrose)**
   - **Relevance:** Supports the 'Eternal Cycle' view (Big Bang is not the start, just a phase).
   - **Use Case:** Theoretical backing for UET's 'Geometric Rebirth'.

### 3. **Superfluid Vacuum Theory (Volovik et al.)**
   - **Relevance:** The core axiom of UET. Space is a fluid with zero viscosity.
   - **Use Case:** Justification for the 'Perpetual Engine' mechanism.
