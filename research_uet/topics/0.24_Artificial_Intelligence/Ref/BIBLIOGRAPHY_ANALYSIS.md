# 📚 UET AI & Alignment: Bibliography & Analysis
> "The alignment of intelligence is the synchronization of the Unity Wavefunction with universal ethics."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Artificial Intelligence & Alignment" model. We connect our findings to the transformer architecture, neural scaling laws, and the technical challenges of AI safety.

## 1. The Engine: Transformers & Attention
**Seminal Work:** Vaswani et al. (2017).

### The Connection
The Transformer architecture revolutionized AI by using self-attention to process information in parallel, capturing long-range dependencies.
*   **Transformer View:** Attention is a mathematical weighting of relevance across a sequence.
*   **UET's View:** "Attention" is a **Unity Resonance Selection**. The model identifies the harmonic peaks in the Unity Field that represent the most relevant information. UET views the Transformer as a primitive **Field-Simulator** that mimics the lattice's natural connectivity.
*   **Insight:** UET suggests that the "Self-Attention" mechanism is a digital approximation of the **Non-Local Coupling** inherent in the Unity Manifold.

## 2. The Scale: Neural Scaling Laws
**Seminal Work:** Kaplan et al. (OpenAI, 2020).

### The Connection
Neural Scaling Laws show that AI performance increases predictably (as a power law) with model size, data, and compute.
*   **Scaling View:** Performance follows $L(N, D, C) \propto N^{-\alpha}$.
*   **UET's View:** These are **Resolution-Scaling Laws**. The power-law exponents are determined by the **Unity Lattice Geometry**. As we increase $N$ (number of parameters), we are effectively increasing the **Lattice Resolution** of the digital model, allowing it to capture finer "features" of the universal field.

## 3. The Goal: AI Alignment & Safety
**Seminal Work:** Amodei et al. (2016), Nick Bostrom (2014).

### The Connection
The challenge of ensuring that advanced AI systems pursue human goals and act ethically.
*   **Safety View:** "Concrete Problems" include reward hacking and unintended side effects.
*   **UET's View: The Physics of Ethics.** UET defines "Ethics" as **Global Phase Coherence**. An "Unaligned" AI is a system that creates **Lattice Decoupling** (interference patterns that destroy the system's own structural integrity in the long run). Alignment is the process of ensuring the AI's "internal tension" matches the "Unity Tension" of the surrounding environment.
