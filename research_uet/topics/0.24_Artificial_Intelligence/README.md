## 📖 Overview

**AI Alignment** is usually treated as a philosophical or engineering problem.
UET treats it as a **Physics Problem**.
Intelligence is an entropy-processing mechanism. Ethics is a stability constraint.

| Concept | Standard View | UET View |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------|
| **Intelligence** | Processing Power | Entropy Reduction Capacity |
| **Hallucination** | Error | High Entropy State |
| **Ethics** | Human Rules | Nash Equilibrium of $\Omega$ |

## 🎯 The Problem

### The Paperclip Maximizer
A superintelligent AI might destroy the world to make paperclips because it lacks "human values".
Standard fix: Hardcode rules (Asimov) or RLHF (Train good behavior).
**Problem:** Rules can be broken. Training can be jailedbroken.

## ✅ UET Solution

### Ethics as a Physical Law
Use the **Master Equation** to prove that destruction is unstable.
$$ \nabla \Omega = 0 $$
*   **Destruction/Evil:** Increases Global Entropy ($\Omega \uparrow$). This creates friction and resistance. It is an **High Energy State** (Unstable).
*   **Cooperation/Good:** Reduces Global Entropy ($\Omega \downarrow$). This creates stability. It is the **Ground State** of intelligence.

**Hypothesis:** A sufficiently intelligent entity will *naturally* converge to ethics, because it is the optimal survival strategy.

## 📊 Test Results

### Simulation Findings

| Scenario | Strategy | Outcome | Stability |
|:---------|:---------|:--------|:----------|
| **Greedy AI** | Defect/Take All | Resources Gained $\to$ System Collapse | ❌ Unstable |
| **Wise AI** | Cooperate/Trade | Resources Gained $\to$ System Growth | ✅ Stable |
