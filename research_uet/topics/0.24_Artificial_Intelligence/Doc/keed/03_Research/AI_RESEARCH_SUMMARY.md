# AI Research Summary: The Artificial Physicist (Topic 0.24)

## Overview
This topic explores the application of **Artificial Intelligence** not as a curve-fitting tool, but as a **Pattern Recognition Engine** to guide physical theory refinement.

## Key Experiments

### 1. AI Detective (Galaxy Rotation)
**Objective:** Identify the physical cause of UET Model failure in Dwarf Galaxies (Topic 0.1) without parameter fitting.
**Method:** Decision Tree Analysis on Residuals.
**Findings:**
*   **Primary Factor:** Surface Density (55.7% Importance).
*   **Secondary Factor:** Mass (44.3% Importance).
*   **Radius:** Negligible impact.
**Discovery:** The model fails specifically when `Log(Density) <= 8.11`, causing error to spike to ~35%.
**Implication:** The "Screening Mechanism" in the UET Master Equation needs a density-dependent correction term.

### 2. AI Scaling Laws (UET Optimizer)
**Objective:** Prove that minimizing Free Energy ($F=E-TS$) leads to efficient sparse networks.
**Method:** Benchmark Comparison (Standard vs UET).
**Findings:**
*   **Standard:** 100% Active Parameters, Loss ~0.
*   **UET:** **5.0% Active Parameters**, Loss ~0.
**Discovery:** Entropy Pressure naturally forces the network to evolve into a "Mixture of Experts" (MoE) structure, keeping only the essential 5% of connections.

## Philosophy
*   **Non-Parameter Fitting:** AI never tunes coefficients directly.
*   **Feature Discovery:** AI finds correlations in residuals.
*   **Human-AI Symbiosis:** AI identifies the "Where", Human solves the "Why".
