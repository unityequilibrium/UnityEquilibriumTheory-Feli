## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** AI Alignment is treated as a social problem, but rules can be broken. Hallucinations are seen as "errors" without a physical metric.
*   **Solution:** **"Ethics as Entropy"**. Coherent, cooperative logic is the high-fidelity, low-entropy state of a system.
*   **Result:** Proved that self-destructive behavior spikes global entropy ($\Omega$), making it physically unstable for intelligent agents.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
Intelligence is an entropy-reduction mechanism. Axiom 2 (Equilibrium) implies that intelligence must converge toward stable, cooperative strategies (Nash Equilibria) to survive in a finite-resource manifold.

---

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
Calculated via the AI Entropy Engine which measures the "Heat of Calculation" for various query prompts.

---

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Matched hallucination rates in legacy LLMs with high correlation to predicted entropy spikes.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This provides a physical basis for Alignment: Ethics is not a preference, but a stability requirement.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
The goal of AI should not be "human values", but "Universal Stability".
