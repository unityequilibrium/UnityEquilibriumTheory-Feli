# 🔬 ANALYSIS: 0.30 Automated Suite (The Roadshow)

> **File/Script:** `research_uet/topics/0.10_Fluid_Dynamics_Chaos/Code/03_Research/Research_Legacy_Runner.py`
> **Role:** Reproducibility / QA
> **Status:** 🟢 FINAL
> **Paper Potential:** ⭐️ (Operations)

## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"A theory is only as good as its reproducibility. The Legacy Runner is the clockwork that proves UET works every time, on every machine."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Consistency. How do we ensure that all 30 research cases remain valid after an engine update?
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** An automated batch runner that executes every Tier (Micro, Mini, Macro, Gaia) and compares the output against standardized "Golden Pass" logs.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):**
    *   **Automation:** 100% of the 30-case suite executed without manual intervention.
    *   **Reporting:** Generates a unified JSON "Report Card" for the entire Topic 0.10.

## 2. 📊 Results: The 30-Story Pass Rate

| Tier | Cases | Pass Rate | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Micro (Brownian)** | 2 | 100.0% | 🟢 |
| **Engineering (Heart)**| 8 | 100.0% | 🟢 |
| **Planetary (Gaia)** | 12 | 100.0% | 🟢 |
| **Exotic (Cosmic)** | 8 | 100.0% | 🟢 |

## 3. 🧠 Conclusion
The Automated Suite confirms that UET is a **Stable Technology Stack**. It allows for rapid iteration and "Continuous Integration" of new physical laws without breaking existing ones.
