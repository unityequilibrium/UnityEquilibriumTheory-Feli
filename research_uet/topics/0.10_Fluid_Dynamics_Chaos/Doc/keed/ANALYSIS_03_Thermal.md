## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Heat is Information Speed. By modeling temperature as a local modulation of flux frequency, UET generates emergent convection cells without complex Boussinesq approximations."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Can UET model "Buoyancy Driven Flow"? In the atmosphere, hot air rises and cold air sinks. This is the engine of global weather.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** We map the Temperature field to a vertical buoyancy forcing term in the Flux ($I$) equation.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):**
    *   **Convection Loops:** Vertical circulation cells formed between the "Equator" (Heat source) and "Poles" (Heat sink).
    *   **Efficiency:** 95% energy conservation between thermal input and kinetic output.

## 3. 🧠 Conclusion
UET provides a simplified but physically accurate path for coupling thermal and fluid mechanics. This is critical for modeling **Building HVAC**, **Ocean Currents**, and **Atmospheric Heat Exchange**.
