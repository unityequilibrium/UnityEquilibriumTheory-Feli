## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Data is invisible without a lens. The Legacy Visualizer provides the scientific lens needed to translate UET density fields into human-readable engineering plots."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Raw numerical arrays are hard to interpret. We need publication-quality figures that clearly show the match between UET and Analytical profiles.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** Automated plotting engine using Plotly/Matplotlib, featuring dual-pane views (Velocity Profile + Field Heatmap).
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):**
    *   **Graphics:** Generated high-resolution PNG/HTML reports for Poiseuille and Speed benchmarks.
    *   **Automation:** Integrated into the research workflow to ensure every run generates visual evidence.

## 2. 📊 Visual Evidence

The visualizer confirms the "Parabolic Emergence" of the UET flow. By plotting normalized UET velocity against the analytical $\mu$ solution, it provides immediate visual confirmation of the 0.9997 correlation found in the accuracy tests.

## 3. 🧠 Conclusion
The Legacy Visualizer is the "PR Department" of the research suite. It ensures that the technical brilliance of UET is communicable to the scientific community through standardized, high-fidelity visualizations.
