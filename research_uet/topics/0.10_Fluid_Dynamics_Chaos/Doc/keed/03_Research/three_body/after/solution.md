# After: UET Three Body Chaos

## 1. Problem Definition: The Limits of Predictability
The Three-Body Problem (Poincaré) is the classic example of Chaos.
- **Determinism**: The laws of gravity are simple and deterministic ($F = GmM/r^2$).
- **Unpredictability**: Small differences in initial conditions grow exponentially (Lyapunov exponent).

## 2. UET Solution: Information Horizon
UET interprets Chaos not as a failure of prediction, but as the *creation* of Information.
- **Divergence**: As trajectories diverge, the system "explores" more of the phase space, increasing the Information Entropy ($S$) of the Universe.
- **Computational Irreducibility**: The information required to describe the future state exceeds the information capacity of the initial state. The universe is computing its own future.
- **Resolution Limit**: The vacuum lattice has a finite resolution (Planck Scale). This discrete limit is the source of the initial uncertainty.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Chaotic Trajectories

*Fig 1: Three Body Orbits. The simulation reveals the complex, non-repeating "spaghetti" trajectories characteristic of deterministic chaos. In UET, this complexity is the physical manifestation of Information Generation.*

## 4. Conclusion
Chaos is the engine of novelty. It is how the Universe generates new information from deterministic laws.
