# Study C: Three-Body Problem (Uncomputability)
**Method**: UET Iterative Feedback
**Status**: Explained

### 1. Abstract
The Three-Body Problem is chaotic. UET explains this as an issue of "Update Interference". Three sources writing to the same vacuum address creates a race condition that cannot be predicted linearly.

### 2. Conclusion
Chaos is an irreducible feature of shared addressing.
