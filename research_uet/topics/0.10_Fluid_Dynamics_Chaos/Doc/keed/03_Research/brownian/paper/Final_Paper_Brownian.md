# Study B: Brownian Motion (Thermal Encoding)
**Method**: UET Entropy Step
**Status**: Conceptual Pass

### 1. Abstract
Brownian motion is the random walk of particles. UET sees this as the visible "Write Noise" of the medium's information processing.

### 2. Conclusion
Heat is the noise floor of the Universal Processor.
