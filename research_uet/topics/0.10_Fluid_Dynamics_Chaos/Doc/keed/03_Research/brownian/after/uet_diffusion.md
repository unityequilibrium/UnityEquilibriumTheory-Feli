# After: UET Brownian Motion

## 1. Problem Definition: The Nature of Randomness
Einstein (1905) explained Brownian motion as the random walk of particles due to collisions with solvent molecules.
- **Classical View**: $\langle x^2 \rangle = 2Dt$. Focuses on the *particle statistics*.
- **UET View**: Why does randomness exist? It is the process of Information Entropy maximization.

## 2. UET Solution: System Entropy Production
UET extends Einstein's analysis by focusing on the Information Field of the system.
- **Entropy Rate**: The random motion generates physical entropy at a rate $dS/dt = P/T$.
- **Information Erasure**: As the particle moves, it "erases" information about its previous position, converting Information Entropy into Thermodynamic Entropy (Landauer's Principle).
- **Universality**: UET defines "Randomness" as the unavoidable quantization noise of the vacuum lattice interacting with matter.

## 3. Results Analysis

### Mean Square Displacement (MSD)

*Fig 1: MSD vs Time. The system follows Einstein's prediction perfectly (Red Dashed), but UET adds the interpretation of Entropy Production Rate (Green dots match).*

## 4. Conclusion
UET unifies Statistical Mechanics with Information Theory. Brownian motion is the visible signature of the vacuum's information processing.
