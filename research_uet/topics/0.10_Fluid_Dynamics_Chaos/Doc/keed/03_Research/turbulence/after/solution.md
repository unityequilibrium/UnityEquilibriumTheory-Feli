# After: UET Turbulence & Kolmogorov Scale

## 1. Problem Definition: The Energy Cascade
Turbulence is the most complex state of fluid motion (Navier-Stokes).
- **Richardson Cascade**: "Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity..."
- **Kolmogorov Scale**: Where does the energy go? It dissipates into heat (entropy) at the smallest scales.

## 2. UET Solution: The Information Cascade
UET models turbulence as a fractal breakup of Information Topologies.
- **Vortices**: Physical vortices are knots in the Information Field.
- **Breakup**: Large knots become unstable and split into smaller knots (Information Decay) to maximize entropy.
- **Viscous Cutoff**: The cascade stops when the knot size approaches the "Information Friction" limit (Viscosity), where topological energy is converted directly into grid noise (Heat).

## 3. Results Analysis

### Energy Stability

*Fig 1: Energy Stability. The Matrix Engine (Orange) maintains stable energy conservation even under chaotic forcing, demonstrating that the UET field equations naturally handle the Energy Cascade without numerical explosion.*

## 4. Conclusion
Turbulence is the efficient processing of Information Entropy. The Kolmogorov scale is the pixel size of the fluid's information processing.
