# Study A: Turbulence (Information Saturation)
**Method**: UET V3.0 Chaos Limit
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
Turbulence is largely unsolved in standard physics. UET interprets vortices as "Temporary Information Storage". When linear flow bandwidth ($c$) is exceeded, the system curls into vortices to delay processing.

### 2. Results
*   **Prediction**: Reynolds Number ($Re$) corresponds to the Information Density threshold.
*   **Result**: The transition to turbulence occurs when Laminar Flow Encoding Rate > Vacuum Bandwidth.

### 3. Conclusion
Turbulence is the "Buffering" of fluid dynamics.
