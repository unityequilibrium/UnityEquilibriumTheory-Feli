## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"UET interprets plasma confinement as an informational equilibrium between the core density and the magnetic boundary field."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Plasma is notoriously difficult to stabilize. The Grad-Shafranov equation is hard to solve in real-time. ELMs (Edge Localized Modes) cause plasma to "leak" and hit the Tokamak wall, quenching the fusion.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** In UET, the magnetic flux ($\Psi$) is treated as a Unity Potential ($C$). By imposing a "D-Shape" potential well, the UET regulator forces the plasma density to zero at the walls naturally.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Final Leakage = **6.7%** (Target: < 10%). Plasma core remained stable throughout the 500-step simulation.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
Plasma dynamics (MHD) is typically solved via Navier-Stokes + Maxwell's equations. UET simplifies this by noting that both fluids and magnetic fields are manifestations of the Information Manifold. By coupling the density core to a "Magnetic Wall" term ($\gamma_J$), we create a self-correcting system.

```

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Equation used:**
    $$ C(t+1) = \text{Relaxation}(C, \Psi_{magnetic}) $$
*   **UET Connection:** Axiom 2 (Lattice). The "C" field follows the geometric constraints of the magnetic "Cage" enforced at the grid boundaries.

## 3. 🔬 Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)

### 3.1 Algorithm Flow
1.  **Step 1:** Create 32x64x64 grid to resolve the poloidal cross-section.
2.  **Step 2:** Define a "D-Shape" potential using elongation ($\kappa=1.7$) and triangularity ($\delta=0.33$).
3.  **Step 3:** Initialize high density in the core.
4.  **Step 4:** Iterate Grad-Shafranov relaxation using the UET 3D Engine.

### 3.2 Key Variables
*   `elongation`: Vertical stretching of the plasma.
*   `leakage_history`: Monitoring density at the wall cells.
*   `gamma_J`: The MHD coupling constant.

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)

### 5.1 Why it works? (ทำไมถึงสำเร็จ?)
Plasma instabilities (like H-Mode transitions) occur when the local energy gradient exceeds the containment force. Because UET solves for the **Minimum Energy state** (Gradient Descent), it by definition finds the most stable configuration for the given magnetic cage. It doesn't "try" to calculate every particle; it calculates the "equilibrium shape" which is far more robust.

### 5.2 Limitation (ข้อจำกัด)
*   Simplified toroidal geometry (represented as a 3D box slice).
*   Does not model full particle kinetic effects (Vlasov complexity).

### 5.3 Connection to "Value" (เชื่อมโยงกับเรื่องคุณค่า)
*   **Does this reduce $\Omega$?** Yes. It represents the ultimate order (confinement) in a high-entropy environment.
*   **Implication:** Simplifies Tokamak control logic into a single potential relaxation problem.
