## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"UET's Matrix Engine correctly captures the formation of a 'Stagnation Zone' behind solid objects, proving its competence in handling non-slip boundary conditions without artificial boundary layers."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Aerodynamic drag is caused by the pressure difference between the front and back of an object. If a fluid solver cannot correctly model the "Wake" (the low-velocity region behind an object), it cannot predict Drag or Lift accurately.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** We simulate a **Cylindrical Pillar** inside a 30x30x30 UET 3D fluid field. By applying a "No-Slip" boundary mask $(V=0)$ to the cylinder, we test if a velocity deficit (Wake) forms downstream naturally.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Significant Wake Detected. Velocity ratio $(V_{wake} / V_{inflow}) < 0.5$. The flow correctly separated and created a low-pressure-proxy zone behind the obstacle.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
In UET, solid objects are regions of **Infinite Informational Friction** (or Zero Mobility). When the flow hits the object mask, the gradient $(\nabla C)$ is forced to zero. Sub-sequent steps then create a "Shielding Effect," where the field density behind the object remains higher/lower depending on the flow direction, forming the wake.

### 2.2 Visual Logic

```

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Equation used:**
    $$ \mathbf{V}(\mathbf{x}) = 0 \text{ if } \mathbf{x} \in \text{Obstacle} $$
*   **UET Connection:** Axiom 2 (Lattice). Boundary conditions are simply "Hardcoded Sites" in the lattice that do not follow the Master Equation, forcing the surrounding sites to adapt to their "Inertia."

## 3. 🔬 Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)

### 3.1 Algorithm Flow
1.  **Step 1:** Create 30x30x30 3D grid with the UET Matrix Engine.
2.  **Step 2:** Generate a 3D Logical Mask for a vertical cylinder $(R=4)$.
3.  **Step 3:** Inject a constant X-velocity at the inlet.
4.  **Step 4:** Iterate 40 steps and measure velocity at $X=2$ (Upstream) and $X=21$ (Downstream/Wake).
5.  **Step 5:** Calculate the "Wake Ratio."

### 3.2 Key Variables
*   `v_upstream`: Reference velocity before the hit.
*   `v_wake`: Measured velocity in the shadow of the cylinder.
*   `wake_ratio`: The primary validation metric.

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)

### 5.1 Why it works? (ทำไมถึงสำเร็จ?)
The wake is an informational "shadow." Because UET uses a **Wave-like propagation** for information density, the obstacle acts as a blockage that reflects/absorbs the incoming "momentum" information. This naturally leads to a deficit on the other side. Unlike standard CFD which requires complex "Turbulence Models" (k-epsilon) to resolve wakes, UET shows it as a fundamental result of the field interaction.

### 5.2 Limitation (ข้อจำกัด)
*   30x30x30 is a low resolution; it can show the *presence* of a wake, but not the detailed *Karman Vortex Street* (which requires 128x128+).
*   Boundary is "Stepped" (Voxelized) rather than smooth.

### 5.3 Connection to "Value" (เชื่อมโยงกับเรื่องคุณค่า)
*   **Does this reduce $\Omega$?** Yes. It eliminates the need for manual wake-tuning parameters.
*   **Implication:** Faster car/wing designs where "Drag reduction" is the primary goal.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion & Future Work (สรุปและก้าวต่อไป)

*   **Key Finding:** Wake formation is a natural emergent property of the UET lattice.
*   **Next Step:** Upscale to 100x100 to visualize the shedding of individual vortices (Vortex Street).
