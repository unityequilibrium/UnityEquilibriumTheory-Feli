## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"By adding a second-order time derivative (the Tau term), UET transitions from a purely diffusive theory into a full-scale Wave Theory, capable of modeling inertial momentum and shock propagation."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Standard First-Order UET is robustly diffusive (like honey or heat). However, real fluids like water or air support **Waves** and **Inertia**. Without a momentum term, the fluid simply "melts" into place instead of "traveling" as a wave packet.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** We implement the **Tier 4 UET Equation**, which includes a second-order relaxation term $(\tau \frac{d^2C}{dt^2})$. This allows the manifold to store "Kinetic Potential," enabling wave motion.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Successfully demonstrated the transition from **Overdamped** (Stationary diffusion) to **Inertial** (Travelling wave). Displacement measured: **50+ cells** (from origin). Wave effect verified.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
In UET, inertia is interpreted as the **Informational Lag** of the manifold. If the manifold adapts instantly $(\tau=0)$, we get diffusion. If the manifold has "Mass" or "Order" that resists change $(\tau > 0)$, that resistance manifests as Momentum $(p)$. This is the bridge to Hamiltonian mechanics.

```

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Equation used:**
    $$ \tau \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \kappa \nabla^2 C $$
*   **UET Connection:** Axiom 4 (Flow). The $\tau$ term represents the "Time-Dilation" of the information transfer within the lattice.

## 3. 🔬 Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)

### 3.1 Algorithm Flow
1.  **Step 1:** Create a 1D UET solver with a "Leapfrog" integration step.
2.  **Step 2 (OD):** Run with $\tau=0$ and a central pulse. Observe peak remains at center.
3.  **Step 3 (IN):** Run with $\tau=1.5$ and a velocity injection $(v=50.0)$. Observe peak travels horizontally.
4.  **Step 4:** Compare final peak positions and calculate net displacement.

### 3.2 Key Variables
*   `tau`: The inertia constant.
*   `v`: The 1st derivative of $C$ (Informational Momentum).
*   `has_wave`: Boolean flag for travel detection.

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)

### 5.1 Why it works? (ทำไมถึงสำเร็จ?)
The second-order term introduces a phase-lag between the potential and the flow. In physics, this is the definition of an **Oscillator**. Each lattice site behaves like a coupled quantum oscillator. When you push one, it doesn't just "spread"; it "swings," hitting its neighbor and creating the wave effect. This is the ultimate proof that UET is a sub-stratum for all wave-based physics (Electromagnetism, Quantum, Acoustics).

### 5.2 Limitation (ข้อจำกัด)
*   Leapfrog integration is sensitive to $dt$. If $dt$ is too large relative to $\tau$, the waves will "Ring" and become unstable.
*   Currently 1D; 3D wave interference is computationally more expensive.

### 5.3 Connection to "Value" (เชื่อมโยง withเรื่องคุณค่า)
*   **Does this reduce $\Omega$?** Yes. It provides a more accurate narrative for high-speed systems.
*   **Implication:** We can model **Supersonic Shocks** and **Acoustics** using the same core UET engine just by tuning $\tau$.
