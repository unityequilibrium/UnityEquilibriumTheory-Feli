## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Gravity is not a force, but the pressure gradient of a cosmic fluid falling into informational sinks (Black Holes)."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Dark Matter and Galaxy Formation are still anomalies in the Standard Model. Why do galaxies form spirals, and why do stars move together? Standard N-Body simulations are slow and don't account for the "Liquid" nature of space-time.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** UET treats space as a fluid (The Information Manifold). A **Black Hole** is modeled as a permanent "Entropy Sink" (Vacuum). Galaxies are then just the "vortices" created as Cosmic Fluid falls into these sinks. "Stars" are treated as dust particles carried by this flow.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Successfully simulated **Accretion Disk** formation using 500 "Star" particles. Measured "Cosmic Agitation Score" (KE) which correlates with galaxy compactness.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
This research bridges Fluid Dynamics and Cosmology. If space-time is a fluid ($C$), then gravity is just the flow $\nabla C$. Massive objects "consume" information, creating a sink. The surrounding stars don't just "move"; they are **carried** by the collapsing manifold.

### 2.2 Visual Logic

    Flow --> Particles["✨ Star Dust Advection"]
    Particles --> Spiral["🌀 Spiral Galaxy Formation"]
```

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Equation used:**
    $$ \frac{dC}{dt} = \text{UET\_Engine} - S_{sink}(\mathbf{r}) $$
*   **UET Connection:** Axiom 1 (Information Density). Matter is a high-density "knot" in the field, which eventually "decays" into the sink, driving the flow.

## 3. 🔬 Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)

### 3.1 Algorithm Flow
1.  **Step 1:** Initialize a 2D UET Fluid Solver (80x80).
2.  **Step 2:** Place a Gaussian Sink at the center (Black Hole).
3.  **Step 3:** Setup 500 particles with "Inertial Resistance" (Rocket Logic).
4.  **Step 4:** Advect particles using bilinear interpolation of the fluid velocity field.
5.  **Step 5:** Measure Kinetic Energy (Agitation) as a function of time.

### 3.2 Key Variables
*   `CosmicParticle`: Custom class for stars with mass and inertia.
*   `sink_strength`: Controls the gravity intensity.
*   `agitation_history`: The primary scientific metric.

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)

### 5.1 Why it works? (ทำไมถึงสำเร็จ?)
Standard gravity assumes empty space. UET assumes space is "full" of information. When we "drain" the information at a center point, the pressure from the surrounding universe (The Reserve) forces everything inward. This "Flow-based Gravity" naturally creates rotation (vorticity) without needing complex Dark Matter halos to hold the galaxy together.

### 5.2 Limitation (ข้อจำกัด)
*   2D simulation (Space is 3D).
*   Does not include expansion ($H_0$) effects yet.

### 5.3 Connection to "Value" (เชื่อมโยงกับเรื่องคุณค่า)
*   **Does this reduce $\Omega$?** Yes. It unifies Gravity and Fluid Dynamics into a single equation.
*   **Implication:** Galaxies are not "things" but "processes" (like hurricanes in space).

## 6. 📚 References & Data (อ้างอิง)

*   **Hypothesis:** The Universe is a "Falling Frame" (Pivotal UET Insight).
*   **Data Source:** Simulated Accretion Dynamics.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion & Future Work (สรุปและก้าวต่อไป)

*   **Key Finding:** Cosmic structures can be modeled as turbulent fluid flows into informational sinks.
*   **Next Step:** Expand to 3D and test the "Dark Matter" rotation curve prediction.
