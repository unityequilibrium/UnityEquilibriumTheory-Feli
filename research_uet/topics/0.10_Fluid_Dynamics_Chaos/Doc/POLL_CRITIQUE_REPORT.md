# 🗞️ FROM THE DESK OF POLL: Research Audit & Critique
**Subject:** Topic 0.10 Fluid Dynamics (30-Case Siege)  
**Date:** Feb 1, 2026

## 1. The Verdict: "Abstraction is the Enemy of Evidence"
I have reviewed the current 'UET Fluid Paper Full Draft' and the surrounding documentation. If a person reads that paper without the context of the 30 underlying scripts, they will learn **nothing**. 

It lacks "Granularity." The names of the specific engineering sieges—the Artificial Heart, the Tokamak, the Waverider—are buried in a list. To an expert, this looks like "Marketing Physics," not "Engineering Physics."

## 2. Specific Failures in Coverage
*   **The 30 Topics are invisible:** I cannot see where 'Brownian Motion' ends and 'Cosmic Accretion' begins. Each of these is a Nobel-level topic, and treating them as a single bullet point is a disservice.
*   **Visual Deficit:** Where are the graphs? If you claim UET matches NASA flight data for the Waverider, I expect to see the **Lift/Drag Polar Plot** comparing UET to the X-43A telemetry.
*   **Calibration Gap:** The `FLUID_MOBILITY_BRIDGE` (1750.0) is the most important "Engineering" finding in 0.10. It is mentioned briefly but not proven with data.

## 3. The "Poll" Recommendation
The user is correct: **Write them separately.** 

Do not try to jam 30 stories into one paper. Instead:
1.  Generate **30 Modular Dossiers** (One for each case).
2.  Each dossier must have: **Problem -> Script -> Result -> Figure.**
3.  Bind them together in a **UET Encyclopedia (The Case Compendium).**

## 4. Understanding vs. Abstraction
If someone reads a modular report on **Case 01 (Artificial Heart)**, they will understand how UET saves lives. If they read the "Full Draft," they only hear about "Topological Scalars." 

**Stop writing about the theory. Start writing about the result.**
