## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **User Question:** "Can light float, or does it need a medium?"
*   **UET Answer:** Light ($I$) requires an **Information Gradient ($\nabla \Omega$)** to be localized. Without a medium, light propagates at $c$ to maximize entropy spread.
*   **Perovskite Solution:** The $ABX_3$ Perovskite lattice acts as a 3D **Information Trap**. Its high Exciton Binding Energy creates a "Heavy Photon" (Polariton) that remains stable at room temperature.
*   **Result:** Perovskite allows for **Volumetric Holograms** that are tangible and stable, unlike 2D Graphene-based slow light.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The "Medium" vs "Vacuum" Paradox
In standard physics, light "floats" in a vacuum but can only be stopped via "Absorption" (which generates heat).
In UET, **Axiom 3 (Attraction)** governs the coupling between the Light Field and the Lattice Field.
- **Vacuum:** No gradient -> Light moves at $c$.
- **Perovskite Lattice:** High symmetric octahedral geometry creates a "Perfect Trap" where the information flow is circular ($v \to 0$), but the energy is $E > 0$.

### 2.2 Why Perovskite?
1.  **Octahedral Resonance:** The structure allows for "Box Resonance." A photon trapped inside the $BX_6$ octahedron behaves like a standing wave in a perfectly matched cavity.
2.  **Polariton Condensation:** Perovskites allow light and matter to hybridize. This "Cold Light" is technically a **Liquid of Information**, making the hologram feel "tangible."

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail (UET Integration)

### 3.1 The 5x4 Grid Mapping
- **Lattice Constant ($a$):** Defines the resonance frequency.
- **Ion Selection ($A, B, X$):** Acts as "Tuning Knobs" for the color of the Cold Light.
- **Axiom 2 (Equilibrium):** The system maintains zero heat because the photon is in a **Geometric Ground State**.

### 3.2 Interaction Formula
$$ v_{group} = c \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{g_{uet}}{\hbar \cdot \Delta \omega} \right) $$
Where $g_{uet}$ is the **Coupling Strength** of the Perovskite information field. In Perovskites, $g_{uet}$ is maximized due to the High-Z elements (like Lead or Tin).

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
By using Perovskite, we solve the user's concern about "floating" light. The light is hosted by the **Perovskite Scaffolding**. This scaffolding can be engineered to be invisible (nanostructured), giving the *illusion* of floating light while maintaining a rigorous physical anchor.

## 6. 📝 Conclusion: The Future of Topic 0.27
Topic 0.27 will now pivot to **"Hybrid Inorganic-Organic Perovskite (HOIP) Hologram Units."** This combines the stability of crystals with the flexibility of UET Information Fields.
