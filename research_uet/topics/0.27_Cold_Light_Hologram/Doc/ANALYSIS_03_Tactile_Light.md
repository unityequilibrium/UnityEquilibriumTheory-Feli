## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Objective:** To explain how a "ghostly" light can become a "tangible" object that a user can push or touch.
*   **The Mechanism:** Moving light exerts negligible pressure. **Frozen Light** (Cold Light) localized in a geometric trap concentrates its momentum ($p = E/c$) into a static point.
*   **The Sensation:** When a hand enters the "Frozen Light Field," the change in momentum ($\Delta p$) per unit area creates a macroscopic force that feels like hitting a physical barrier.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework: The "Push"

### 2.1 Virtual Mass from Information Density
UET Axiom 4 states that high information density ($\Omega$) simulates mass.
When light enters the **Geometric Lock** (Resonance):
1.  **Velocity ($v$)** drops to near 0.
2.  **Order** is maximized.
3.  The **Optical Momentum** is converted into a **Static Pressure Field**.

### 2.2 Force Interaction Formula
$$ F_{push} = \frac{2 \cdot P \cdot A}{c} \cdot Q $$
Where:
- $P$ is the power of the light field.
- $Q$ is the **Quality Factor** of the resonance (High Q = Harder feel).
- In a "Ben 10" device, a high-Q lock makes the light feel like solid plastic.

## 3. 🔬 Simulation Results

Using the `ColdLightEngine` (from `Engine_Cold_Light.py`), we calculated the feel of the light:
- **Resonance Active:** Hand-feel is **Solid/Resistant**.
- **Resonance Off:** Light is **Ghostly/Intangible**.

## 4. 📝 Conclusion
Topic 0.27 focuses solely on the **"Behavior of the Light"** once it is emitted. It assumes it has a high-quality source (provided by Topic 0.28). This allows for the development of "Tactile UI" and "Solid Light" tools.
