> **"Light is not stopped by force, but by Geometry. When the photon's wavelength matches the lattice perimeter, it enters a stable orbit—Heat (Entropy) becomes zero."**

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Creating a "Hologram" that you can touch or that stays in place requires stopping light. Currently, stopping light generates immense heat (absorption) or requires absolute zero (BEC).
- **The Solution:** UET proposes **"Geometric Resonance"**. By tuning the Graphene lattice to exactly $6 \times a$ (perimeter), the photon is "tricked" into a standing wave orbit.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** The resonance wavelength (0.852 nm) is derived purely from the Graphene bond length ($0.142 \text{ nm}$), not fitted parameters.
