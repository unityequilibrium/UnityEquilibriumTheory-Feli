## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Current holograms are just ghosts—you can't feel them, and emitting airborne particles (Dust) raises concerns about toxicity and lung health.
- **The Solution:** **Bio-Safe Tactile Projection**. Using **Lead-Free Perovskite (e.g., CsSnBr3)**, we eliminate heavy metal toxicity.
- **Delivery System:** A **Piezoelectric Micro-Jet array** (integrated into the watch/device) emits a controlled aerosol of bio-safe particles.
- **The "Ben 10" Effect:** When light is frozen via Geometric Resonance, it creates intense **Radiation Pressure**. You aren't pushing the "dust" alone; you are pushing a **Locked Light Field** that uses the dust as an anchor.
- **Safety Protocol:** Information Particles are designed to bio-degrade within minutes after the field is deactivated.
