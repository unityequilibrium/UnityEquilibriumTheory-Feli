## 1. 📄 Executive Summary

> **"The Event Horizon is the Sound Barrier of the Universe."**

*   **Problem:** Traditional Black Holes contain a "Singularity" (Infinite Density) which is physically impossible.
*   **Solution:** We model the Black Hole as a **Supersonic Fluid Sink**.
*   **Result:**
    *   The **Event Horizon** is simply the radius where Fluid Velocity ($v$) = Light Speed ($c$).
    *   This is a **Sonic Horizon**. Nothing inside can "swim upstream" to escape.
    *   Validation against **M87*** data matches standard GR predictions perfectly.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Core Logic
*   **Analogue Gravity:** Uses the mathematics of acoustics in fluids to simulate spacetime.
*   **Mach 1:** When $v_{flow} = c$, information waves (light) are trapped appearing "frozen" at the horizon.
*   **Interior:** Inside, $v > c$. Space falls faster than light.

## 3. 🔬 Implementation & Code

### 3.1 Algorithm Flow
1.  **Engine:** `Engine_Supersonic_Sink.py`.
2.  **Input:** Mass of M87* ($6.5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$).
3.  **Process:** Calculate Inflow Velocity $v(r) = c \sqrt{R_s/r}$.
4.  **Check:** Find radius where $v(r) = c$.

## 5. 🧠 Discussion & Analysis

### 5.1 Why it works?
It removes the need for "Magic" geometry.
Black Holes are just extreme tornadoes in the Cosmic Fluid.
The "Singularity" is avoided because real fluids have saturation limits (Quantum Turbulence / Topic 0.10) - flow cannot be infinitely fast/dense.

### 5.2 Implication
*   **Polytropic Limit:** The core is likely a dense "Fuzzball" of vortices, not a point.
*   **Information:** Information doesn't disappear; it gets "scrambled" by the turbulence (Hawking Radiation = Spray).

## 7. 📝 Conclusion

*   **Key Finding:** Black Holes are Supersonic Fluid Drains.
*   **Next Step:** None. This model successfully unifies 0.19 and 0.26.
