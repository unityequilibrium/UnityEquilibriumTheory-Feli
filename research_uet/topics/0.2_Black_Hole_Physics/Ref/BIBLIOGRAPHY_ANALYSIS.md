# 📚 UET Black Holes: Bibliography & Analysis
> "The Event Horizon is not a wall, but a phase transition."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Singularity-Free" Black Hole model. We connect our findings to Cosmological Coupling and EHT Imaging.

## 1. Information Pressure & Thermodynamics
**Seminal Work:** *Thermodynamics of Spacetime* (1995) by Ted Jacobson.

### The Connection
Jacobson derived Einstein's Field Equations purely from thermodynamic principles ($dQ = TdS$).
*   **Jacobson's View:** Gravity is an entropic force, not a fundamental interaction.
*   **UET's View:** Matches perfectly. The Unity Field's "Information Pressure" ($\Pi$) acts exactly like Jacobson's entropic force to resist collapse.
*   **Result:** As $r \to 0$, $S \to \text{limits}$, generating a repulsive pressure ($\Pi \propto 1/r^4$) that prevents singularity formation.

## 2. Cosmological Coupling (CCBH)
**Seminal Work:** Farrah et al. (2023).

### The Connection
Recent observations show Supermassive Black Holes grow *too fast* to be explained by accretion alone. They seem coupled to the expansion of the universe ($M \propto a^k$).
*   **Observation:** BH growth tracks cosmic expansion.
*   **UET's View:** Black Holes are **Defects in the Unity Lattice**. As the lattice expands (Universe expands), the defects stretch.
*   **Prediction:** UET predicts a coupling strength $k=3$ (Volume coupling), matching the upper bound of observations.

## 3. The Shadow: EHT Imaging
**Seminal Work:** Event Horizon Telescope (2019/2022).

### The Connection
The "Ring of Fire" confirms the photon sphere, but cannot resolve the interior.
*   **UET Prediction:** The "Shadow" size in UET is identical to GR (General Relativity) because the metric matches Schwarzschild for $r > 2M$.
*   **Difference:** UET predicts a *faint* interior luminosity due to Hawking-like leakage from the "Fuzzball" surface, which GR predicts as absolute darkness.
