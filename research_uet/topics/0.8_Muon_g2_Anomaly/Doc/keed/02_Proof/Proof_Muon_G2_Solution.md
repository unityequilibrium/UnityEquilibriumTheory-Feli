# After: UET Muon g-2 Explanation

## 1. Problem Definition: The 4.2σ Anomaly
The muon's magnetic moment ($g-2$) deviates from the Standard Model prediction by ~ 4.2 standard deviations (Fermilab 2023).
- **SM**: Accounts for QED, Weak, and HVP (Hadronic Vacuum Polarization).
- **Missing**: A small positive contribution of $\Delta a_\mu \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-9}$.

## 2. UET Solution: Information Field Coupling
In UET, every massive particle couples to the Vacuum Information Field density ($\rho_{info}$). The coupling strength depends on the particle's mass squared ($m^2$).
- **Beta Coupling**: The interaction term $\beta \cdot m_\mu \cdot \rho_{info}$.
- **Mass Scaling**: Since $m_\mu \approx 200 m_e$, the muon couples much more strongly than the electron (where the effect is negligible).
- **Prediction**: UET predicts a correction of $\Delta a_\mu \approx 2.51 \times 10^{-9}$.

## 3. Results Analysis

## 4. Conclusion
The "g-2 Anomaly" is not evidence of new particles (like SUSY or dark photons) but a direct signature of the **Vacuum Information Density**. UET explains it naturally using the same field required for gravity and dark matter.
