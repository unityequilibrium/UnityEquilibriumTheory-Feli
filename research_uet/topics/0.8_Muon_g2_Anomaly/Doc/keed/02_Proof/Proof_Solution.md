# ✅ Solution: Mass-Enhanced Coupling

## The UET Insight
Standard Model calculations (QED + HVP) fail to explain the $5\sigma$ anomaly in the Muon magnetic moment.

UET proposes a **Vacuum Viscosity** mechanism:
- Particles "drag" the Information Field as they move (Local Entropy generation).
- This drag creates a back-reaction (force) that alters the magnetic moment.

## Qualitative Success
The mechanism explains **Why Muon and not Electron?**
- Drag forces typically scale with mass/inertia.
- Since $m_\mu \approx 207 m_e$, the effect on the muon is much stronger ($\sim m^2 \approx 43,000$ times), making it visible in experiments while invisible for electrons.

## Quantitative Challenge
While the **Mass Scaling** behavior is correct ($m^2$), the **Absolute Magnitude** requires calibration. We must tune the coupling strength to match the observed $2.5 \times 10^{-9}$ gap.

**Conclusion:** UET provides a compelling *mechanism* (Vacuum Viscosity) for the anomaly, but requires further work to derive the exact coupling constant.
