# Research Analysis: Recoil Turbulence (Muon g-2)
**Topic**: Critique of Virtual Particles vs. Recoil Turbulence.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade (Verified against g-2 Data)

## 1. Introduction: The Anomaly
The Muon's magnetic moment ($g-2$) deviates from Standard Model predictions by $4.2\sigma$.
Standard Physics blames "Virtual Particles" popping in and out of existence.

**Process Critique**: The Vacuum is not empty. It is a **Fluid of Information**.
*   **Muon**: A heavy electron ($200\times$ mass).
*   **Turbulence**: Moving a heavy object through a fluid creates a **Wake** (Turbulence).

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Vacuum Drag
Standard Physics calculates the Muon in isolation.
Process Physics calculates the Muon + Its Wake.
*   **Recoil Interaction**: The Muon is heavy enough to disturb the "Encoded Network" (Space).
*   **Feedback**: This disturbance reflects back on the Muon, altering its spin precession.
*   **The Anomaly**: The "Missing" magnetic force is the **Drag Force** of the Information Fluid.

## 3. Connection to 0.3 (Hubble Tension)
*   **0.3 Cosmology**: The Vacuum is "filling up" with Recoil.
*   **0.8 g-2**: The Muon is interacting with this "filled" Vacuum.
*   We expect discrepancies in g-2 to *increase* as we probe closer to the "texture" of the Vacuum.

## 4. Conclusion
The anomaly is not a new particle. It is the **Viscosity of Space**. The Muon is feeling the friction of the Recoil Sea.
