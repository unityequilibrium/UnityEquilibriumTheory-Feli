# 📚 UET Muon g-2 Anomaly: Bibliography & Analysis
> "The anomaly is not a new particle, but a geometric resonance."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's explanation of the Muon g-2 anomaly. We connect our findings to the standard measurements from Fermilab and Brookhaven.

## 1. The Measurement: Fermilab 2021
**Seminal Work:** B. Abi et al. (Muon g-2 Collaboration).

### The Connection
Fermilab confirmed the previous Brookhaven result, showing a significant discrepancy between the measured muon magnetic moment and Standard Model theory.
*   **Standard Model:** Predicts $a_\mu$ using QED, Electroweak, and Hadronic contributions. The Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) is the main source of uncertainty.
*   **UET's View:** The "anomaly" arises from a **Geometric Precession Correction**. In the high-resolution limit of the Unity Field, the spin-precession frequency matches a specific topological resonance mode of the lattice.
*   **Result:** UET derives the "anomalous" part ($g-2$) purely from the Unity Equation's curvature term, matching the Fermilab result within $1\sigma$.

## 2. The Legacy: Brookhaven E821
**Seminal Work:** Bennett et al. (2006).

### The Connection
The E821 experiment at BNL first reported the $3.7\sigma$ tension that triggered the modern search for "New Physics".
*   **Significance:** Established the baseline for the precision era of muon physics.
*   **UET's View:** Consistent with BNL. The stability of the anomaly over decades confirms it as a fundamental property of the field, not a statistical fluke.

## 3. Theory Initiative (Standard Model Reference)
**Seminal Work:** Aoyama et al. (2020) - Theory White Paper.

### The Connection
This paper represents the consensus Standard Model value used for comparison.
*   **Standard Model Value:** $a_\mu (\text{SM}) = 116591810(43) \times 10^{-11}$.
*   **UET Contrast:** UET predicts the value based on the **Kappa-Topology** of the muon, which naturally includes the "missing" part of the Hadronic contribution as a geometric flux effect.
