## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Traditional agriculture relies on seasonal cycles with long waiting times and low yields. Standard extraction methods waste energy and produce impure compounds.
- **The Solution:** UET uses **Acoustic Nutrient Delivery** and **Graphene Nano-Refining** to accelerate photosynthesis and selectively extract compounds with 98% purity.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** Growth acceleration is achieved through information field resonance, not chemical fertilizers.
