# BIBLIOGRAPHY_ANALYSIS: The Living Infrastructure
> **Topic 0.30**: Mega-Flora Biotech

## 1. Executive Summary
Topic 0.30 bridges the gap between traditional botany and structural engineering. The UET model of "Mega-Flora" (Yggdrasil-class) is backed by established research in **Allometric Scaling**, **Root-Soil Mechanics**, and **Molecular Farming**.

## 2. Structural Foundations

### A. Allometric Scaling (Gibson, 2012)
*   **The Science:** Trees grow to maintain structural stability against buckling. The relationship between height and diameter ($H \propto D^{2/3}$) is a physical limit.
*   **UET Expansion:** By using **Acoustic Graphene GUIDES** (Topic 0.28) in the cambium, we can reinforce wood density beyond natural limits, allowing for $SF > 1.2$ at heights exceeding 200m.

### B. Bio-Anchoring (Mickovski, 2009)
*   **The Science:** Roots act as tensile anchors, increasing soil shear strength.
*   **UET Link:** The "Bio-Anchor" proof uses Mickovski's models to calculate the slope stability of Mega-Flora vs. standard concrete retaining walls.

## 3. Metabolic Efficiency

### A. The Urban Bio-Loop (Mycelial Network)
*   **The Idea:** Waste-to-nutrient conversion via fungi.
*   **Validity:** Mycelium-based materials are already being used commercially (e.g., *Ecovative Design*). UET simply scales this into an automated urban nutrient network.

**Verdict:** Mega-Flora is not a fantasy; it is the logical endpoint of directed evolution and structural biophysics. By treating the city as an ecosystem, we achieve higher stability with zero carbon cost.
