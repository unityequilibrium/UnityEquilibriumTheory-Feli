# 🧬 BIBLIOGRAPHY ANALYSIS: Mega-Flora Biotech
> **Topic 0.30**: Validation of Concept

## 1. Molecular Farming (Meat Fruit) 🍎🥩
**Is it real?** YES.
**Current State:**
*   **Company:** *Moolec Science* (Listing: MLEC)
*   **Tech:** "Piggy Sooy" -> Soybean seeds that contain Pig Myoglobin (Pink Soybeans).
*   **Science:** Using Agrobacterium to insert animal DNA sequences (Myoglobin/Casein) into the plant's seed storage protein system.
*   **UET Application:** We will scale this up from "Seeds" to "Fruits" (Yggdrasil Fruit) for higher biomass.

## 2. Self-Healing: Tree vs Concrete 🧱🌳
**Mechanism:** **CODIT** (Compartmentalization of Decay in Trees).
*   **How it works:** Trees don't "heal" like skin (regenerate tissue); they "seal" (wall off damage).
*   **Walls 1-4:** Chemical barriers (gums/resins) trap the rot. New wood grows *around* the wound.
*   **Why it beats Concrete:** Concrete cracks keep spreading (Fatigue). Trees stop the spread and grow stronger outer layers (Anti-Fragile).

## 3. The "Bio-Anchor" (Root Mechanics) 🌏⚓
**Field:** **Biomimetic Geotechnics**.
*   **Mechanics:**
    1.  **Shear Strength:** Roots act like "Rebar" in concrete (Soil = Concrete, Roots = Steel).
    2.  **Hydraulic Lift:** Deep taproots pull water from deep aquifers to dry surface soil (preventing landslides from mud).
*   **UET Application:** The Yggdrasil's taproot (30m depth) will replace traditional steel sheet piles for the Thailand Water Management plan.

**Verdict:**
Science exists. We just need to "Scale it up" (Mega-Flora).
