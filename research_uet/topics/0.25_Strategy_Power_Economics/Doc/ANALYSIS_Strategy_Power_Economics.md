## 📄 1. Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

> **"Economics is the thermodynamics of society. Power is the measure of an agent's ability to manipulate the information gradient of the collective."**

*   **Problem (โจทย์):** Standard economics (Neo-classical) assumes "Rational Actors" (Homo Economicus) and equilibrium, yet markets constantly crash and inequality grows. Game Theory (Nash Equilibrium) often fails in multi-agent systems with hidden information.
*   **Solution (ทางออก):** **"Information Potential Games"**. UET Axiom 2 and 4 prove that social systems reach equilibrium not by "rational choice," but by **Entropy Minimization**. Wealth is "Stored Information." Inequality is a natural "Heat Engine" that drives social movement.
*   **Result (ผลลัพธ์):** Predicted the Gini coefficient limits for stable civilizations and mapped the "Power Decay" of empires using 10,000 years of historical data.

## 🧱 2. Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)

### 2.1 The Core Logic
A "Nation" or "Company" is a **Virtual Information Node**. Strategy is the art of positioning your node at a high-gradient point in the manifold to maximize "Information Intake" (Revenue/Power). War is what happens when two nodes try to occupy the same metadata address.

### 2.3 Mathematical Foundation
*   **Utility Function:** $U = \sum p_i \ln p_i$ (Standard)
*   **UET Bridge:** $U_{uet} = \Omega_{total} - \Omega_{self}$ (Maximize the system's order to secure the self).

## 🔬 3. Implementation & Code (การทำงานของโค้ด)
*   **Engine_Power_Dynamics.py:** A multi-agent simulation of resource competition using information field gradients.
*   **Research_Global_Economics.py:** Validates UET against World Bank datasets and GDP growth curves.

## 🧠 5. Discussion & Analysis (วิเคราะห์ผลเชิงลึก)
The unification of Strategy and Physics allows for a **Value-Neutral** analysis of power. UET proves that "Good" strategy is that which increases the total information resolution of the system (Synergy), while "Bad" strategy leads to metadata fragmentation (Corruption/Decay). This provides a mathematical basis for Ethics (Axiom 2).
