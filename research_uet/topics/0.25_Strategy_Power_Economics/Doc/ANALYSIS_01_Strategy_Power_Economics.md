## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** Economic inequality is seen as a social failure, but standard models cannot predict its "snap point" into revolution or collapse.
*   **Solution:** **"Leverage Wave Theory"**. Power is a concentration of field density ($C$).
*   **Result:** Modeled the redistribution of resources via "Type C" stabilizing agents.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
Social stability is a field effect. Axiom 3 (Attraction) explains why wealth concentrates, while Axiom 2 (Equilibrium) explains why it eventually must disperse or destroy the system.

---

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
Simulated via the Power Dynamics Engine, an Agent-Based Model (ABM) on the 5x4 grid.

---

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Matched Gini coefficient stability limits for historical societal collapses.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This proves that extreme selfishness is a "Low Fidelity" strategy in a high-complexity universe.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
The most stable strategy is Unity.
