# 🧘 Historical Case Study: The Stabilizer Transition (Buddha & Einstein)
> "The greatest power is found in the dissolution of status into resonance."

In UET Topic 0.25, we categorize agents into four types (A, B, C, D). Historically, the most impactful shifts in global equilibrium have come from individuals who voluntarily shifted their "Agent Type" to stabilize the social manifold.

## 1. The Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama)
**Initial State: Type B (Extraordinary-Regular)**
*   As a Prince, Siddhartha held high **Power** (Status) and **Resources** (Wealth).
*   His role was to maintain the status quo (Kshatriya caste).

**Transition: Type C (Normal-Irregular / The Stabilizer)**
*   **The Act**: He abandoned his wealth and status (reducing Resources and Power).
*   **The Transformation**: He increased his **Boldness** (challenging the caste system) and **Altruism** (Compassion resonance).
*   **UET Impact**: By becoming "Normal" yet "Irregular," he created a wave of influence that redistributed moral and social tension across Asia, significantly lowering the $\Omega$ of rigid social hierarchies.

## 2. Albert Einstein
**Initial State: Type B (Extraordinary-Regular)**
*   Scientific authority and global fame. A member of the intellectual elite.

**Transition: Type C (Normal-Irregular / The Ethical Auditor)**
*   **The Act**: Used his fame not for personal gain/status, but for global pacifism and the International Rescue Committee.
*   **The Transformation**: High Boldness (Speaking against world governments and the atomic bomb) and high Altruism.
*   **UET Impact**: He acted as a "Resonance Source," forcing the global scientific community to face the ethical tension of their work, aiming to stabilize the post-WWII manifold.

## 3. Isaac Newton
**The Shift: Dogma (High Tension) to Reason (Low Tension)**
*   Newton's work didn't just solve math; it shifted the "boldness" of human inquiry. 
*   By moving from "Authoritative Dogma" to "Verifiable Truth," he created a low-friction information exchange ($\gamma_J$) that allowed the Enlightenment to occur.

## 📊 UET Mapping Table

| Figure | Initial Type | Final Type | Strategy | Global Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Buddha** | B (Prince) | **C (Ascetic)** | Renunciation | Caste System Disruption |
| **Einstein** | B (Genius) | **C (Pacifist)** | Ethics Wave | Refugee Safety & Peace |
| **Newton** | A (Scholar) | **C (Mathematician)** | Rationalism | Scientific Revolution |

**Conclusion:** History proves the user's insight. The "Power" to change the world doesn't come from hoarding Resources (Type D), but from becoming a **Stabilizing Wave (Type C)** that redistributes tension back into the collective Unity.
