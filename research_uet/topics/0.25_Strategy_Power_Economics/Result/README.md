## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Modern power structures (Economic/Political) are trapped in **Zero-Sum Games**. High-resource selfish agents (Predators) naturally distort the manifold, leading to extreme inequality ($\Omega$) and systemic instability.
- **The Solution:** UET identifies **Type C Agents** (Normal Power, High Boldness, Low Selfishness) as the physical stabilizers of the manifold. By using the **Wave of Influence**, these agents can "dissolve" concentrated tension and return the system to equilibrium.
- **The Leverage Metaphor:** Proves that 'Boldness' is a higher-order strategic asset than 'Resource Mass'.
