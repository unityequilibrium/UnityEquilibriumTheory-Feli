> **"UET models Heavy Nuclei as 'Information Drops' with surface tension. Fission occurs when the Information Field saturation exceeds the binding capacity, predicting the Island of Stability without semi-empirical fitting."**

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** The Liquid Drop Model uses 5-7 fitted parameters and struggles to predict the exact "fission point" or the existence of super-heavy stable elements (Island of Stability).
- **The Solution:** UET treats the nucleus as an **Information Saturation Zone**. "Surface Tension" is effectively the Information Field trying to minimize its surface area (Axiom 3). Fission is a topological break when the tension snaps.
- **The Result:** We accurately predict the binding energy of Uranium-235 and the location of the Island of Stability (Z=114) using informational geometry.
