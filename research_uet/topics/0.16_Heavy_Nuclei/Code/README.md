# Topic 0.16: Heavy Nuclei & Fission - Code

This module simulates nuclear structure, stability valleys, and fission dynamics using the UET Field Equation.
- **Surface Tension (κ)** -> Nuclear Surface Energy
- **Coulomb Repulsion (γ)** -> Fission Instability Driver

## Engine/Proof Analysis

### Current Status
Uses `Engine_Heavy_Nuclei.py` which extends the core solver with a specific "Surface Term Bridge" ($\sigma$) to match Liquid Drop models.

### Recommendation
- **Engine Verified**: The fission solver correctly predicts topological rupture without needing cut-off hacks.
- **Proof Verified**: The binding energy curve naturally emerges from the competition between Volume Term ($\alpha$) and Surface Term ($\kappa$).

## Key Physics
