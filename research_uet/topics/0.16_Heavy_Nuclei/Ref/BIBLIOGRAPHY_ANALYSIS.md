# 📚 UET Heavy Nuclei: Bibliography & Analysis
> "The Island of Stability is the point where the Unity Lattice reaches harmonic saturation."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Heavy Nuclei & Shell Model" logic. We connect our findings to the synthesis of superheavy elements, the nuclear shell model, and alpha decay theory.

## 1. The Frontier: Superheavy Elements (SHE)
**Seminal Work:** Yuri Oganessian (2015) & GSI Darmstadt.

### The Connection
The synthesis of elements up to Oganesson (Z=118) has pushed nuclear physics into the region of extreme instability.
*   **Standard View:** Superheavy elements are stabilized by "magic numbers" of nucleons that fill nuclear shells.
*   **UET's View:** Nuclei are **Coherent Lattice Clusters**. The "magic numbers" are the **Geometric Packing Limits** of the Unity Manifold. When the number of nucleons matches a specific tetrahedral or icosahedral packing mode of the lattice, the stability increases exponentially.
*   **Result:** UET predicts new "Magic Modes" beyond Z=126 by calculating the higher-order harmonics of the Unity Field.

## 2. The Architecture: Nuclear Shell Model
**Seminal Work:** Maria Goeppert Mayer (1949).

### The Connection
Mayer discovered that nucleons occupy distinct energy levels (shells), similar to electrons in an atom.
*   **Shell Model View:** Spin-orbit coupling explains the stability of magic numbers.
*   **UET Connection:** UET's "Atomic Physics" and "Heavy Nuclei" bridges use the same **Resolution-Scaling** logic. The shells are not energy levels in a potential well, but **Standing Wave Envelopes** of the global field.

## 3. The Escape: Alpha Decay & Tunneling
**Seminal Work:** George Gamow (1928).

### The Connection
Alpha decay was the first application of quantum tunneling to the nucleus.
*   **Gamow's View:** The alpha particle tunnels through the Coulomb barrier.
*   **UET's View:** Tunneling is a **Manifold Phase Slip**. The alpha particle doesn't "move through" a barrier; the field's phase at the barrier point temporarily "thins," allowing the lattice resonance of the alpha particle to re-form on the other side.
