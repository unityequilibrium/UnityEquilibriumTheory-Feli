# 🚧 Limitation: Heavy Nuclei

## Problem Statement

### The Classical View
Nuclear binding energy is well-measured but:
- **Semi-empirical mass formula** — fitted, not derived
- **Magic numbers** — unexplained shell structure

### Key Question
**Why do nuclei have specific binding energies?**

---

## The Gap

1. **Bethe-Weizsäcker formula** — 5 fitted parameters
2. **Shell model** — describes but doesn't explain magic numbers
3. **No unified principle** — nuclear and atomic physics disjoint
