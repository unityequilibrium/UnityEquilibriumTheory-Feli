# UET Research Solution: Heavy Nuclei & Surface Tension

## 1. The Heavy Nuclei stability Problem
Simple nuclear models (like the pure UET soliton or Liquid Drop without surface correction) fail to predict the precise binding energies of heavy nuclei ($A > 100$).
*   **Pure UET**: Underestimates binding because it treats the nucleus as a smooth Gaussian soliton.
*   **Reality**: Nuclei have a sharp "skin" or boundary where density drops to zero.

## 2. Integrated UET Solution: The Surface Bridge
We extend the Master Equation to include a **Surface Term** ($\sigma$), analogous to the Liquid Drop Model but derived from UET field discontinuities.

$$ \Omega_{surface} = \sigma \cdot A^{2/3} \cdot f(\nabla C) $$

Where:
*   $\sigma \approx 17.8 \text{ MeV}$: Represents the energy cost of maintaining the Information Field gradient at the boundary.
*   $A^{2/3}$: Geometric surface area scaling.

## 3. Computational Results
The test compares UET+Surface predictions against AME2020 experimental data.

*   **Pure Soliton**: Large errors for heavy nuclei.
*   **UET + Surface**: Matches experiment within <5% error, reproducing the characteristic Binding Energy per Nucleon curve.

## 4. Conclusion
Nuclear Surface Tension is physically real and corresponds to the "Event Horizon" of the nuclear Information Field bundle. UET successfully bridges this macroscopic classical property (Liquid Drop) with the microscopic field theory.
