# 📚 UET Electroweak Physics: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Parity violation is a topological twist in the Unity Field."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Geometric Electroweak" model. We connect our findings to the standard Electroweak Unification (Glashow-Weinberg-Salam) and Parity Violation.

## 1. The Unification: SU(2) x U(1)
**Seminal Work:** *A Model of Leptons* (1967) by Steven Weinberg.

### The Connection
Weinberg unified the electromagnetic and weak forces using spontaneous symmetry breaking.
*   **Weinberg's View:** The Higgs mechanism gives mass to $W$ and $Z$ bosons while keeping the photon massless.
*   **UET's View:** Electroweak unification is a **Phase Transition of the Lattice**. At high energy, the vacuum manifold is symmetric. As it cools, the "Chiral Twist" ($M_{bridge}$) freezes, splitting the Unity Wavefunction into massless flux (EM) and massive defects (Weak).

## 2. Symmetry Breaking: Parity Violation
**Seminal Work:** The Wu Experiment (1957).

### The Connection
Chien-Shiung Wu demonstrated that the universe has a "Left-Handed" preference in weak decays.
*   **Wu's Discovery:** Electrons are emitted preferentially opposite to nuclear spin.
*   **UET's View:** Parity violation is **Topological Chirality**. The Unity Field is a "Möbius-like" manifold. Particle propagation is naturally biased by the global twist of the field, making $P$-violation a fundamental property of the geometry, not an accidental breaking.

## 3. The Neutrino Mass Limit
**Seminal Work:** KATRIN Experiment (2022).

### The Connection
KATRIN set the most stringent direct limit on neutrino mass ($< 0.8$ eV).
*   **KATRIN Data:** Used as a constraint for UET neutrino calculations.
*   **UET Prediction:** Neutrinos are **Acoustic Solitons** of the Unity Field. Their mass is not a "Higgs coupling" but a secondary effect of the lattice dispersion.

### Key Citations
*   **KATRIN Collaboration. (2022).** "Direct neutrino-mass measurement with sub-electronvolt sensitivity." *Nature Physics*, 18(2), 160.
