# Limitation: The W Mass Anomaly (CDF II)

### The Problem
In 2022, the CDF II collaboration at Fermilab reported a measurement of the W boson mass ($M_W$) that deviated significantly from the Standard Model prediction (7$\sigma$ discrepancy).

*   **Standard Model**: $80,357 \pm 6$ MeV
*   **CDF II Measurement**: $80,433 \pm 9$ MeV

### The Gap
The Standard Model has **no freedom** to adjust this mass without breaking the delicate electroweak symmetry relationships ($M_W / M_Z = \cos \theta_W$).

### The Necessity
We need a theory that naturally predicts a slightly heavier W boson (or a geometric correction) without adding arbitrary "new particles" like Supersymmetry does.
