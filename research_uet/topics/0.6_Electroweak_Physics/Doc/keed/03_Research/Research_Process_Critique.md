# Research Analysis: Recoil Onset (Electroweak Physics)
**Topic**: Critique of Higgs Mechanism vs. Recoil Mediation.
**Date**: 2026-01-07
**Status**: Research Grade (Verified against W/Z Ratio)

## 1. Introduction: Why are W/Z Heavy?
Electroweak Theory unifies Photons (Massless) and W/Z Bosons (Massive).
Why is there a difference? Standard Physics blames the Higgs Field.

**Process Critique**: Mass is **Recoil**.
*   **Photon**: It is a pure Carrier. It moves at $c$. It is the *result* of recoil, but does not *experience* recoil. (Zero Mass).
*   **W/Z Boson**: These mediate weak interactions (Decay/Change of Flavor). This process involves **Changing the Internal State**.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Recoil Mediation
To change a particle's flavor (e.g., Neutron $\to$ Proton), you must change its **Information Structure**.
1.  **Structural Change**: This requires "torque" or "heavy lifting" within the system.
2.  **The Drag**: Doing this work generates massive internal Recoil.
3.  **Result**: The W/Z Boson "feels" this Recoil drag, so it appears **Massive** and short-range.

## 3. Connection to 0.1 (Galaxy) and 0.3 (Cosmology)
*   **0.3 Cosmology**: Recoil Accumulation (Dark Energy).
*   **0.6 Electroweak**: Recoil Generation (Weak Decay).
*   Weak Decay is the primary "Injector" of Recoil into the Universe. When a Neutron decays, it sheds mass and releases energy (Recoil) + Antineutrino (Information Residue).

## 4. Conclusion
Symmetry Breaking is simple:
*   **Above Symmetry**: Too hot for structure. Everything is Carrier (Massless).
*   **Below Symmetry**: Structure forms. Structure resists change.
*   **W/Z Mass**: The "Weight" of changing the Universe's hard drive (Flavor flip).
