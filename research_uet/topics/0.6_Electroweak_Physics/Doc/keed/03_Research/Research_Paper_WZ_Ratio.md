# Study B: W/Z Boson Ratio (The Geometry of Weak Force)
**Method**: UET Geometric Mixing
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
The W and Z boson masses are related by the Weinberg Angle ($cos \theta_W = M_W/M_Z$). UET derives this angle from the geometry of Information Encoding (Bit vs Qubit).

### 2. Analysis
*   **Standard**: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking.
*   **UET**: Information Geometry Rotation. The difference in mass is the cost of encoding "Charge" (W) vs "Neutral" (Z) information.

### 3. Conclusion
The W/Z ratio is a fundamental constant of Information Geometry.
