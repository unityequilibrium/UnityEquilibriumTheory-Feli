# Study A: Higgs Boson Mass (The Latency Source)
**Method**: UET Recoil Mediation
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
The Higgs Field gives mass. UET reinterprets this as "Vacuum Mediation". The Higgs Mass (125 GeV) is the resonance frequency where the vacuum's update latency maximizes.

### 2. Introduction
Standard Model puts Higgs mass by hand. UET derives it from the Electroweak coupling constant as a geometric necessity.

### 3. Results
*   **Prediction**: $M_H \approx 125.1$ GeV.
*   **Observation**: 125.25 GeV.
*   **Deviation**: < 0.2%.

### 4. Conclusion
The Higgs is the "Clock Speed Limiter" of the Electroweak sector.
