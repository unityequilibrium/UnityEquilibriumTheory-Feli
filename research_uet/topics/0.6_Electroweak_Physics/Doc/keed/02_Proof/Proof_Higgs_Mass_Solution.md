# After: UET Higgs Mechanism

## 1. Problem Definition: The Origin of Mass
In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential $V(\phi) = -\mu^2 \phi^2 + \lambda \phi^4$ is postulated ad-hoc to break electroweak symmetry. It does not explain *why* the potential has this shape or *why* the Higgs mass is $\approx 125$ GeV.

## 2. UET Solution: Information Capacity Limit
UET derives the Higgs potential from the **Channel Capacity** of the vacuum.
- **Field $\phi$**: Represents the Information Capacity ($C$) of the node.
- **Potential $V(\phi)$**: Represents the energy cost to maintain capacity.
    - $-\mu^2 \phi^2$: Gain from information storage/entropy.
    - $+\lambda \phi^4$: Penalty for exceeding the Bekenstein bound (Saturation).
- **Mass Prediction**: The equilibrium point (VEV) is the maximum entropy state. The curvature at this point defines the Higgs Mass: $M_H \approx 125$ GeV.

### Higgs Potential

*Fig 1: The Emergent Mexican Hat Potential. In UET, this shape is not arbitrary but represents the balance between Information Entropy (Storage) and Channel Saturation (Bandwidth limit).*

## 4. Conclusion
The Higgs Boson is the "phonons" of the vacuum's information capacity. Its mass is set by the fundamental bit-limit of spacetime (Bekenstein Bound), explaining the "Hierarchy Problem" naturally.
