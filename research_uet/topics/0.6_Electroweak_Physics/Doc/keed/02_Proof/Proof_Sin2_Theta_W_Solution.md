# After: UET Weinberg Angle Running

## 1. Problem Definition: The Running Coupling
The Weak mixing angle ($\sin^2 \theta_W$) is not a constant but "runs" with energy scale $Q$. Standard Model uses Renormalization Group Equations (RGE) to predict this running, but the physical origin of the running is abstract.

## 2. UET Solution: Information Screening
UET interprets "Running Coupling" as **Information Screening**.
- **Low Energy (Low Q)**: The probe sees a large "pixel" of the vacuum, averaging over multiple lattice nodes. Screening increases effective charge.
- **High Energy (High Q/Z-pole)**: The probe resolves the bare lattice geometry.
- **Formula**: $\sin^2 \theta_W(Q) = \sin^2 \theta_W(Z) [1 + k \ln(M_Z/Q)]$, derived from the information bit-density variance.

## 4. Conclusion
The "running" of the Weinberg angle is proof of the discrete, lattice-like nature of the information vacuum. UET predicts the slope of this running from first principles.
