# ✅ Solution: Geometric Unification

## The UET Insight
Standard Model treats the mixing angle $\theta_W$ as a fundamental parameter that must be measured.

UET proposes that $\theta_W$ emerges from the **Competition between Information Coupling ($\beta$) and Spatial Gradient Penalty ($\kappa$).**

$$ \sin^2 \theta_W = \frac{\beta}{\beta + \kappa} $$

## Meaning
- **$\beta$ (Information):** Propagates state (Z-like neutral current).
- **$\kappa$ (Space):** Resists change (W-like charged current geometry).
- The "Weak Force" is effectively the **Information field struggling to propagate through Space-Time memory.**

## Implementation
```python
# In electroweak_solver.py
# We currently invert the formula to find the implied ratio:
kappa_beta_ratio = (1 / sin2_theta_w) - 1
# Result: Kappa ~ 3.3 * Beta
```

## Conclusion
While we currently calibrate the specific value, the **mechanism** provides a geometric origin for the Weak Mixing Angle, replacing an abstract SM parameter with a concrete ratio of vacuum properties.
