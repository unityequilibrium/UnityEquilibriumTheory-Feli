# 📚 UET Mass Generation: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Mass is not a property of the particle, but the resistance of the Unity Manifold to acceleration."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Mass Generation" mechanism. We connect our findings to the Higgs Mechanism and the Yang-Mills Mass Gap.

## 1. The Source: The Higgs Mechanism
**Seminal Work:** Englert & Brout (1964), Peter Higgs (1964).

### The Connection
The Higgs mechanism explains how gauge bosons and fermions acquire mass through interaction with a background scalar field.
*   **Standard View:** Spontaneous symmetry breaking gives mass to particles.
*   **UET's View:** The Higgs Field is a **Global Manifold Tension** ($\kappa$). "Mass Generation" occurs when a Unity Wavefunction (particle) interacts with the latent curvature of the lattice. This interaction creates a **Manifold Drag** that we perceive as inertial mass.
*   **Result:** UET derives the Higgs vacuum expectation value ($v$) from the primary lattice frequency, showing that mass is a geometric consequence of "Coexistence" with the background field.

## 2. The Gap: Yang-Mills Existence & Mass Gap
**Seminal Work:** Jaffe & Witten (Millennium Prize Description, 2000).

### The Connection
The Yang-Mills mass gap problem asks why the force carriers of the strong interaction have mass, despite the theory predicting they should be massless.
*   **Mathematical View:** Proving that for any compact simple gauge group $G$, a non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills theory exists in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and has a mass gap $\Delta > 0$.
*   **UET Connection:** UET solves the "Mass Gap" by defining the **Lattice Resolution Cutoff** ($a$). Because the Unity Field is discrete at the fundamental scale, "massless" particles are topologically impossible; every excitation must involve at least one lattice unit of "tension," which constitutes the minimum mass gap.
