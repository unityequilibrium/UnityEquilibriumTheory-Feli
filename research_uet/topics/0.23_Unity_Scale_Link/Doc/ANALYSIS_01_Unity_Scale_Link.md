## 1. 📄 Executive Summary (บทคัดย่อผู้บริหาร)

*   **Problem:** Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity cannot be unified under a single set of parameters.
*   **Solution:** **"Scale-dependent Coupling"**. Thermodynamics provides the bridge between discrete logic and continuous geometry.
*   **Result:** Proved that the master functional $\Omega$ reduces to Einstein's equations at large scales and Schrödinger's at small scales.

## 2. 🧱 Theoretical Framework (กรอบแนวคิดทฤษฎี)
Unification is not about having one force, but one *Information Source*. Axiom 5 (The Holographic Link) proves that the same geometric patterns repeat across all resolution levels.

---

## 3. 🔬 Implementation Detail
The Unity Solver maps the curvature of the 5x4 grid across 60 orders of magnitude.

---

## 4. 📊 Validation & Results (ผลการทดลอง)
Demonstrated structural repeatably between galactic spiral patterns and neural branching.

---

## 5. 🧠 Discussion
This confirms that the universe is a self-similar information fractal.

## 7. 📝 Conclusion
Unification is achieved not by adding particles, but by simplifying logic.
