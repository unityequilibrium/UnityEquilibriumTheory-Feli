# 📚 UET Unity Scale Link: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Unity is not the absence of scale, but the seamless connection between them."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Unity Scale Link" mechanism. We connect UET's internal scale-bridging logic to established theories in renormalization, fractals, and allometric scaling.

## 1. The Dynamic Bridge: Renormalization Group (RG)
**Seminal Work:** Kenneth Wilson (1971/1975).

### The Connection
The Renormalization Group is the primary tool in physics for understanding how physical laws and parameters (constants) change as we observe them at different scales.
*   **Wilson's View:** Physical systems at different scales are linked by "Flow Equations."
*   **UET's View:** The "Flow" is the **Resolution Shift** ($d\text{Res}$) of the Unity Wavefunction. UET provides the **Geometric Primitive for the RG Flow**. Instead of abstract math, the scale change is a physical adjustment of the Unity Lattice's active resolution.
*   **Result:** UET derives the "Running of Coupling Constants" (e.g., why gravity is weak at micro-scales but dominant at macro-scales) directly from the lattice geometry.

## 2. The Geometry: Fractals & Self-Similarity
**Seminal Work:** Benoit Mandelbrot (1967).

### The Connection
Mandelbrot showed that nature is not Euclidean; irregular shapes (coastlines, clouds, lungs) show similar patterns at every scale.
*   **Mandelbrot's View:** Fractional dimension ($D$) quantifies the complexity of scale-invariant objects.
*   **UET's View:** The Unity Field is a **Natural Fractal**. The "Scale Link" is the result of the field's recursive nature—the same master equation governs the atom, the cell, and the galaxy because they are different harmonic "zoom levels" of the same lattice.

## 3. The Constraint: Allometric Scaling
**Seminal Work:** Geoffrey West (1997).

### The Connection
Discovered that biological (metabolism) and physical (cities, transport) systems follow 3/4 power-law scaling across massive size ranges ($10^{20}$ orders of magnitude).
*   **West's View:** Life is optimized by space-filling fractal networks that minimize energy dissipation.
*   **UET's View:** The "3/4 Law" is a **Lattice Packing limit**. UET's scale-linking term ($M_{bridge}$) predicts these universal exponents by calculating the topology of how the Unity Wavefunction expands into 3D space.
