## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are fundamentally incompatible. GR predicts singularities (infinite density), while QM requires discrete states. The "Theory of Everything" remains elusive.
- **The Solution:** UET **Axiom 1** establishes Information as the fundamental constituent. By treating space-time as an **Information Manifold**, we naturally bridge the gap: Gravity is the thermodynamic pressure of information, while quantum effects are information fluctuations.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** All universal constants ($G, c, h, k_B$) are derived from the Information Capacity limits, not fitted to experiment.
