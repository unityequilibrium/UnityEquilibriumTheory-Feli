# 🌌 Topic 0.0: Grand Unification (Theory of Everything)
> **Objective:** Unify Classical, Quantum, and Cosmological physics under a single Information-Geometric framework.

## 1. 📂 5x4 Grid Structure
The **Grand Unification** topic serves as the master bridge between all other UET research areas. It defines the universal constants and the thermodynamic balance that governs the 5 Axioms.

- **Doc/**: The core UET Axioms and philosophical derivation.
- **Data/**: Unified Metric logs from across the 31 topics.
- **Code/**: `Engine_Grand_Unification.py` (The Master Solver).
- **Result/**: Proof that the "Simple Truth" Master Balance holds at all scales.

## 2. ⚡ Quick Start
```powershell
# Run the Master Balance check
python research_uet/topics/0.0_Grand_Unification/Code/03_Research/Research_Grand_Unification.py
```

## 3. 🔗 Core Axioms
1. **Axiom 1 (Order):** Information is the fundamental constituent.
2. **Axiom 2 (Equilibrium):** Systems move toward thermodynamic stability.
3. **Axiom 3 (Interaction):** Coupling ($\kappa$) links disparate scales.
4. **Axiom 4 (Complexity):** Emergence is a byproduct of information density.
5. **Axiom 5 (Horizon):** The limit of observability defines the physical frame.
