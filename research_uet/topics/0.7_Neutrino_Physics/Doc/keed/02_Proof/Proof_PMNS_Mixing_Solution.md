# After: UET PMNS Mixing Matrix

## 1. Problem Definition: Large Mixing
Unlike quarks (CKM matrix), where mixing is small, neutrinos (PMNS matrix) have large mixing angles.
- **Question**: Why is $\theta_{23}$ nearly $45^\circ$ (Maximal)? Why is $\theta_{13}$ small?

## 2. UET Solution: Geometric Mixing
UET derives mixing angles from the **Geometry of the Vacuum Lattice**.
- **$\theta_{12} \approx 30^\circ$**: Corresponds to the hexagonal packing symmetry ($\pi/6$).
- **$\theta_{23} \approx 45^\circ$**: Corresponds to the node-link diagonal ($\pi/4$).
- **$\theta_{13} \approx 0$**: Suppressed by the lattice stability factor (channel crosstalk).
- **Difference from Quarks**: Quarks are "bound" to nodes (rigid), leading to small mixing. Neutrinos are "free" windings, exploring the full geometry (large mixing).

## 4. Conclusion
The "anarchic" look of neutrino mixing is actually a reflection of the discrete symmetries of the underlying spacetime lattice. UET provides a geometric derivation for these angles.
