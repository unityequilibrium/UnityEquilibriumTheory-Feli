# After: UET Beta Decay Spectrum

## 1. Problem Definition: Weak Universality
The Standard Model asserts that the weak interaction strength ($G_F$) is constant. This is tested by measuring the *ft-values* of superallowed beta decays. Constancy implies universality.

## 2. UET Solution: Information Transfer Rate
UET interprets weak decay as an **Information Transfer** process between lattice nodes (quarks).
- **Rate**: Controlled by the channel width ($\beta_{weak}$) and the lattice update frequency.
- **Universal Constant**: Since the vacuum lattice is uniform, the information transfer rate ($\beta_{weak}$) must be identical for all nuclei, independent of nuclear structure.
- **Prediction**: ft values should be constant (flat line).

## 3. Results Analysis

### ft-Value Constancy

*Fig 1: Experimental ft-values for superallowed decays. The data (Red Points) aligns perfectly with the constant average (Green Dashed Line), validating the UET premise of a uniform vacuum information metrics.*

## 4. Conclusion
The constancy of beta decay rates is a direct confirmation of the **Information Universality** principle in UET. The weak force is not an arbitrary interaction but a fundamental property of the spacetime channel capacity.
