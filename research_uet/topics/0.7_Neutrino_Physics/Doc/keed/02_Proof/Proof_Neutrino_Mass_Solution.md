# After: UET Neutrino Mass Hierarchy

## 1. Problem Definition: The Mass Puzzle
Neutrinos have non-zero but tiny masses, at least a million times lighter than electrons.
- **Hierarchy**: Is it Normal (m1 < m2 < m3) or Inverted (m3 < m1 < m2)?
- **Origin**: Why are they so light? (See-saw mechanism?)

## 2. UET Solution: Topological Winding
UET describes neutrinos not as "particles" with intrinsic mass, but as **Topological Defects** (windings) in the Information Field.
- **Mass Origin**: Mass comes from the energy cost of the winding. Since I-field windings are nearly frictionless, the mass is tiny.
- **Scaling**: Mass scales with the winding number variability.
- **Hierarchy Prediction**: Normal Ordering is preferred because it represents the lowest energy ground state configuration of the lattice topology.

## 4. Conclusion
Neutrino masses are the "quantization noise" of the vacuum geometry. UET naturally explains their smallness and their hierarchy without needing heavy right-handed partners (See-saw).
