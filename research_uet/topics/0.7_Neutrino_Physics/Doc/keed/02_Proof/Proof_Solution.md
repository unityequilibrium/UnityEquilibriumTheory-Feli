# ✅ Solution: Discrete Information Geometry

## The UET Insight
Standard Model parameters (mixing angles) often appear random or arbitrary ($33.4^\circ$, $49.2^\circ$).

UET proposes that these angles are "shadows" of a **Discrete Geometry** in the Information Field.

## The Logic
1.  **Neutrinos = Minimal Information Packets:** Being nearly massless, they interact most directly with the "grid" of the vacuum.
2.  **Hexagonal Lattice:** The most efficient way to pack information (bees, bubbles) is hexagonal.
    - This naturally suggests angles like $30^\circ$ ($\pi/6$) and $60^\circ$.
    - **Result:** $\theta_{12} \approx 30^\circ$ matches Solar mixing ($33^\circ$).
3.  **Maximal Mixing:** For heavy states ($\nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$), the I-field gradients are steep, forcing a "diagonal" path through the lattice.
    - **Result:** $\theta_{23} \approx 45^\circ$ matches Atmospheric mixing ($49^\circ$).

## Verify it yourself
The simplified solver `neutrino_solver.py` validates this geometric hypothesis against PDG data. While not a derivation, the close match ($\sim 10\%$ error purely from integer fractions like $\pi/6$) is highly suggestive.
