# 📉 Limitation: The Geometric Ansatz

## The Problem
UET predicts Neutrino Mixing Angles (PMNS Matrix) based on **Geometric Symmetries** of the Information Lattice (Hexagonal, Diagonal).
- $\theta_{12} \approx 30^\circ$ (Hexagonal symmetry, $\pi/6$)
- $\theta_{23} \approx 45^\circ$ (Maximal mixing, $\pi/4$)

However, these symmetries are **Hypothesized (Ansatz)**, not yet derived analytically from the Master Equation $\Omega$.

## Why is this a limitation?
While the values match experiment well (~10% error), we cannot yet prove *why* the Information Field adopts this specific hexagonal/diagonal structure at the neutrino scale. It remains a phenomenological model inspired by geometry.

## Honest Admission
- **$\theta_{12}, \theta_{23}$:** Are **[GEOMETRIC ANSATZ]** parameters.
- **$\theta_{13}$:** Is a **[SCALED PARAMETER]** ($\kappa \times 17^\circ$), fitted to match the reactor magnitude ($8.5^\circ$).
- **$\delta_{CP}$:** Is **[CALIBRATED]** to the T2K best fit ($195^\circ$).

We do not claim to have "solved" neutrino mixing from first principles yet—only that a geometric model provides a compelling fit.
