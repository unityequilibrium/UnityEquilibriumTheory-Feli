# Study A: Neutrino Mass (The Recoil Receipt)
**Method**: UET Recoil Residue
**Status**: Conceptual Verification

### 1. Abstract
Neutrinos are "Ghost Particles". UET proposes they are the "Receipts" of information transactions. They carry the exact amount of Recoil needed to balance the books (Conservation Law).

### 2. Results
*   **Mass**: Extremely light because they carry *only* the address data, not the payload.
*   **Oscillation**: Address rotation between axes ($e, \mu, \tau$).

### 3. Conclusion
Neutrinos are pure "Metadata".
