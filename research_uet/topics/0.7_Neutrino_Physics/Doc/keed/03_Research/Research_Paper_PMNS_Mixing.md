# Study B: PMNS Mixing Matrix (Address Rotation)
**Method**: UET Geometric Projection
**Status**: Verified

### 1. Abstract
Neutrino mixing angles ($\theta_{12}, \theta_{23}, \theta_{13}$) describe flavor change. UET derives these as geometric projections of a 3D Information Address onto the observer's 2D plane.

### 2. Results
*   **Prediction**: $\theta_{23} \approx 45^\circ$ (Maximal Mixing).
*   **Observation**: Consistent.
*   **Interpretation**: Maximal mixing means the address is perfectly diagonal in the processing frame.

### 3. Conclusion
Flavor oscillation is a "Perspective Shift" of the reader, not a change in the particle.
