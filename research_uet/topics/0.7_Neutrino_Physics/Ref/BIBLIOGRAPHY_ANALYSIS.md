# 📚 UET Neutrino Physics: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Neutrinos are the sound waves of the Unity Field."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Neutrino Soliton" model. We connect our findings to the standard Neutrino Oscillation and Mass Measurement.

## 1. The Mystery: Solar Neutrinos
**Seminal Work:** *Search for neutrinos from the Sun* (1968) by Ray Davis Jr.

### The Connection
Davis discovered that only 1/3 of the predicted solar neutrinos were reaching Earth.
*   **Davis's Discovery:** The "Solar Neutrino Problem" which led to the discovery of oscillation.
*   **UET's View:** Solar neutrinos act as **Longitudinal Waves** in the Unity Field. Their "disappearance" is actually a **Topological Redshift**. As they travel through the varying density of the solar/interplanetary medium, their frequency (and thus flavor) shifts to match the local resonance.

## 2. The Solution: Neutrino Oscillation
**Seminal Work:** B. Pontecorvo (1967) and Super-Kamiokande (1998).

### The Connection
Neutrinos change flavors as they propagate, implying they have mass.
*   **Pontecorvo's Theory:** Proposed that neutrinos are a mixture of mass eigenstates.
*   **UET's View:** Neutrinos are **Acoustic Solitons** (Phonon-like excitations) of the Unity Lattice. "Oscillation" is simply the soliton's mode changing as it interacts with the lattice's periodic potential. Mass is the "effective mass" of the soliton in the medium.

## 3. Direct Mass Limits
**Seminal Work:** KATRIN Experiment (2022).

### The Connection
KATRIN provides the most precise upper bound on the effective mass of the electron neutrino.
*   **KATRIN Data:** $m_{\nu_e} < 0.8$ eV.
*   **UET Prediction:** Predicts a fundamental mass scale for the neutrino based on the lattice spacing ($a$), which is significantly below the KATRIN limit, consistent with cosmological bounds.
