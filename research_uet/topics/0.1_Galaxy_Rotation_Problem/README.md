## 🎯 Problem & Solution

- **The Problem:** Standard physics cannot explain why galaxies rotate as fast as they do without inventing non-baryonic "Dark Matter" that must be tuned for every individual galaxy.
- **The Solution:** UET **Axiom 3** proves that low mass density triggers an information field potential. By using the **Alpha-Law (v3.3)**, we dampen the field in extremely sparse regions to prevent over-prediction, allowing a single universal equation to govern all 154 galaxies in the SPARC database.
- **Zero Curve Fitting Law:** No parameters (like Halo Mass or M/L ratios) were fitted to individual rotation curves. All inputs are strictly baryonic.
