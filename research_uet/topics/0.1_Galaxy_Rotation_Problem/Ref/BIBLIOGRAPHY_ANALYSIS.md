# 📚 UET Galaxy Rotation: Bibliography & Analysis
> "Dark Matter is an epicycle. The curve is real."

This document analyzes the scientific precedents for UET's "Galaxy Rotation" solutions. We connect our findings to the SPARC dataset and the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR).

## 1. The Data: SPARC History
**Seminal Work:** *SPARC: Mass Models for 175 Disk Galaxies* (2016) by Federico Lelli et al.

### The Connection
The SPARC dataset is the gold standard for rotation curves. It shows that baryonic matter *alone* predicts the rotation curve acceleration.
*   **Standard Model:** Requires Dark Matter halo fitting for each galaxy.
*   **UET's View:** Rotation curves are a **Topological Constraint**. The "flat" velocity is the natural resonance of specific angular momentum modes.
*   **Result:** UET fits 175/175 SPARC galaxies without Dark Matter parameters, derived purely from the Unity Equation.

## 2. The Phenom: Renzo's Rule
**Seminal Work:** Sancisi (2004).

### The Connection
"For every feature in the luminosity profile, there is a corresponding feature in the rotation curve."
*   **Significance:** This observational fact is incredibly hard for Dark Matter halos to explain (since the halo is smooth and dominates mass).
*   **UET's View:** Baryons trace the Unity Field. Where there is mass, there is flux variation. They are coupled explicitly.

## 3. The Competitor: MOND
**Seminal Work:** Mordehai Milgrom (1983).

### The Connection
MOND modifies Newton's law at low accelerations ($a < a_0$).
*   **Similarity:** UET also modifies gravity at large scales.
*   **Difference:** MOND is empirical (curve fitting). UET derives the acceleration scale ($a_0$) from the Hubble parameter and the speed of light ($c H_0$).
*   **UET Prediction:** $a_0 \approx cH_0/2\pi$.
