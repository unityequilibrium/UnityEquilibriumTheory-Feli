# On the Meaning of (c) and (C)

## 1. Distinction Between (c) and (C)

In this work, a strict distinction is maintained between the lowercase symbol (c) and the uppercase symbol (C).
Although typographically similar, the two symbols represent **conceptually and mathematically distinct entities**.
Failure to separate them leads to ambiguity and invalid interpretation of the model.

## 2. Lowercase (c): Physical Constant

The lowercase symbol (c) is reserved **exclusively** for the universal physical constant:

[
c = 299{,}792{,}458\ \mathrm{m/s}
]

representing the speed of light in vacuum.

### Properties of (c):

* Scalar constant
* Invariant under space–time transformations
* Independent of position and time
* Serves as an upper bound on signal propagation and causal influence
* Appears in established physical theories (SR, GR, QFT)

[
\textbf{Rule: } c \text{ is never treated as a dynamical variable.}
]

Any use of (c) outside this role is considered notationally invalid.

---

## 3. Uppercase (C): UET System Variable

The uppercase symbol (C) denotes a **dynamical field** defined within the Universal Equilibrium Theory (UET):

[
C = C(x,t)
]

### Interpretation:

* A system-level coordination / communication field
* Possesses dynamics and spatial structure
* May admit gradients, diffusion, or coupling terms
* Participates explicitly in the system functional (\Omega)

For example:
[
\Omega = \Omega[E,S,C]
]

or
[
\partial_t C = D_C \Delta C + F(E,S)
]

Importantly, **(C) bears no relation to the physical speed of light**.

## 4. Why Capitalization Matters

In mathematical physics, capitalization carries semantic weight:

| Symbol    | Typical Meaning                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| lowercase | constants, scalars, local quantities |
| uppercase | fields, operators, global structures |

Canonical examples include:

* (h) vs. (H): Planck constant vs. Hamiltonian
* (g) vs. (G): metric tensor vs. Newton’s constant
* (c) vs. (C): speed of light vs. system field (UET)

This distinction is not stylistic; it is part of the formal grammar of the discipline.

## 5. On the Expression (\Omega = c,I)

If (I) represents a UET-defined quantity, then the expression
[
\Omega = c,I
]
is **notationally incorrect**, as it implicitly conflates a physical constant with a system coupling.

### Correct alternatives:

* If a physical constant is intended:
  [
  \Omega = c,I \quad (\text{explicitly physical})
  ]

* If a system coupling is intended:
  [
  \Omega = \kappa, I \quad (\kappa \neq c)
  ]

* If a UET field mediates the relation:
  [
  \Omega = C \cdot I
  ]

Ambiguous use of (c) is strictly avoided.

## 6. Notation Convention (Normative)

> **Notation Convention**
>
> * (c): reserved exclusively for the physical speed of light or maximal causal propagation constant.
> * (C): denotes the UET coordination/communication field.
> * Lowercase (c) is never used as a dynamical variable within UET.

This convention is adopted throughout the paper.

---

## 7. Summary

* (c) and (C) belong to different conceptual layers.
* (c) is inherited from established physics and remains fixed.
* (C) is internal to UET and carries system dynamics.
* Maintaining this separation prevents semantic drift and uncontrolled model variation.
