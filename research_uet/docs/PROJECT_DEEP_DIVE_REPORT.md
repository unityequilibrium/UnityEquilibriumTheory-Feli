# Project Deep Dive Report: Unity Equilibrium Theory (UET)

## 1. Executive Summary

The UET project is a massive, highly structured codebase designed to validate a "Grand Unified Theory" using computational physics. It enforces strict engineering standards ("Triple-Green") to ensure rigorous, data-driven validation across 25+ physics domains. The core philosophy is "Nature is constrained optimization," implemented via a universal Master Equation.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into a clear hierarchy:

*   **`research_uet/core/`**: The "Engine Room". Contains the single source of truth for the Master Equation and parameters.
*   **`research_uet/topics/`**: The "Evidence Locker". Contains 25+ sub-folders, each representing a specific physics domain (e.g., Galaxy Rotation, Fluid Dynamics, Quantum Computing).
*   **`research_uet/docs/`**: Technical documentation and theoretical foundations.
*   **`research_uet/scripts/`**: Utility and maintenance scripts.

### Key Observation: The "Bio-Digital" Architecture
The project structure mimics a biological system:
*   **DNA**: `core/uet_master_equation.py` (The immutable laws)
*   **Organelles**: `topics/*` (Specialized functional units)
*   **Immune System**: `integrity checks` and strict parameter policies.

## 3. Core Engine Architecture

### 3.1 The Master Equation (`uet_master_equation.py`)
The heart of the project is the `omega_functional_complete` function, which minimizes the functional $\Omega[C,I]$. It implements 7 key terms derived from 12 axioms:

1.  **Energy ($V(C)$)**: Standard potential.
2.  **Space Memory ($\kappa|\nabla C|^2$)**: Geometric tension cost.
3.  **Info Coupling ($\beta C \cdot I$)**: The critical link between Matter and Information.
4.  **Exchange ($\gamma_J \nabla \cdot J$)**: Open system dynamics.
5.  **Natural Will ($W_N |\nabla \Omega|$)**: Existence persistence.
6.  **Game Dynamics ($\beta_U V_{game}$)**: Competitive energy optimization.
7.  **Coherence ($\lambda \Sigma \Delta C^2$)**: Multi-layer stability.

**The "Value Equation"**: The engine explicitly defines "Value" as the rate of disequilibrium reduction: $\mathcal{V} = -\Delta\Omega$.

### 3.2 Parameter Policy (`uet_parameters.py`)
The project enforces a **"NO PARAMETER FITTING"** policy.
*   Parameters ($\kappa, \beta$) are scale-dependent but fixed for each scale (Planck, Electroweak, Galactic).
*   They are defined in a registry (`UETParameters`) and matched to experimental constants (e.g., $\kappa_{nuclear}$ calibrated to $\alpha_s$).
*   **Integrity Kill Switch**: `INTEGRITY_KILL_SWITCH` variable ensures the engine can be globally disabled to detect "shadow math" (fake calculations).

## 4. Research Domains (Topics)

The theory is tested across a vast range of scales. Notable topics include:

*   **0.0 Grand Unification**: The synthesis of all domains.
*   **0.1 Galaxy Rotation**: Solves Dark Matter via dynamic viscosity ($a_0$).
*   **0.10 Fluid Dynamics**: Uses 5x4 grid robust path finders; heavily populated with scripts.
*   **0.18 Mathnicry**: Migrated topic (formerly just "Topic 0.18").
*   **0.3 Cosmology**: Addresses Hubble Tension and Dark Energy.

## 5. Engineering Standards

The project utilizes a "Triple-Green" standard for validation:
1.  **100% Pass Rate**: All scripts must run and validate against real data.
2.  **5x4 Architecture**: Every topic folder follows a strict Logic/Evidence/Narrative/Citation/Proof grid.
3.  **Zero-Fudge Integrity**: No arbitrary parameters; constants must be derived.

## 6. Recommendations

*   **Documentation Indexing**: The `docs/` folder is extensive. A dynamic index or "Knowledge Graph" could help navigation.
*   **Topic 0.18 Cleanup**: The existence of both `0.18_Mathnicry` and `0.18_Quantum_Computing` might be a temporary migration state. Verify if they should be merged or distinct.
*   **Test Coverage**: While "Pass Rate" is emphasized, verifying the *quality* of tests (e.g., edge cases in `verify_all_limits`) is crucial.
