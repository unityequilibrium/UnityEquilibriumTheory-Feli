# UET Theory Map v2.1: The Complete Universe
**Purpose**: To visualize the connection between UET and **ALL** pillars of physics (Classical, Crypto/Thermo, Relativity, Quantum).

## 1. The Tree of Physics
UET ($\Omega = c \cdot I$) is the Root. All other theories are branches describing specific behaviors of Information Processing.

## 2. Concept Translation Dictionary
How "Normal World" concepts translate to "UET Information" concepts.

| Domain | Standard Concept | UET Translation | Why it matches? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Classical** | **Force** ($F$) | **Information Gradient** ($\nabla I$) | Things move to where Information Density is lower (High $P$ to Low $P$). |
| **Classical** | **Inertia** ($m$) | **Update Latency** ($\tau$) | Heavy objects take more cycles to update position. |
| **Classical** | **Action** ($S$) | **Total Cost** | Sum of all energy usage over time. Min $S$ = Min Cost. |
| **Classical** | **Lagrangian** ($L$) | **Efficiency Rate** | How well the system balances Kinetic vs. Potential. |
| **Thermo** | **Entropy** ($S$) | **Address Scrambling** | Lost order = Harder to find the address. |
| **Thermo** | **Heat** ($Q$) | **Write Noise** | Energy released when bits are flipped. |
| **Relativity** | **Gravity** ($g$) | **Capacity Pressure** | Saturation of storage bends the path. |
| **Quantum** | **Wave** ($\Psi$) | **Search Alg** | System checking all possible addresses. |
| **Quantum** | **Collapse** | **Found Address** | System locks onto one ID. |
| **Quantum** | **Mass Gap** | **Initialization Cost** | $I_{min}$ requires energy $>0$ to exist. |
| **Cosmology** | **Volume** ($V$) | **Total Equilibrium** ($\Omega_{total}$) | $V$ is the capacity of the Universe. Max $\Omega$ requires Max $V$. |

## 3. The Unity System Flowchart
How the Universe processes a single event (e.g., an apple falling).

    participant GR as Einstein View
    participant Thermo as Entropy View

    Note over Reality: Apple connects to Earth
    
    Reality->>Reality: Calculate Gradient
    
    par Classical View
        Classical->>Classical: F = GmM / r^2
        Note right of Classical: "Force pulls it down"
    and GR View
        GR->>GR: Curvature Geodesic
        Note right of GR: "Space pushes it down"
    and UET View
        Reality->>Reality: Maximize I-Flow
        Note left of Reality: "System minimizes Latency"
    end

    Reality->>Thermo: Apple hits Ground
    Thermo->>Thermo: Scattering (Heat)
    Note right of Thermo: "Information becomes Noise"
```

## 4. Why no Contradiction?
*   **Classical Physics** describes the **Result** (The apple fell).
*   **UET** describes the **Reason** (Why it fell: To balance Information Density).
*   They are compatible because Mechanism ($F=ma$) $\neq$ Origin ($\nabla I$).

## 5. The Critical Variable: Volume ($V$)
The user has identified that **Volume is the Key**.
*   **$V = \Omega_{Total}$ (The Big Omega)**
*   The Universe expands (increasing $V$) because it seeks to maximize its Total Equilibrium ($\Omega$).
*   **Expansion is not a force; it is a Requirement.** To store more Information ($I$) without overheating (Efficiency), the System *must* increase its storage capacity ($V$).
*   **Result**: $V \propto \sum \Omega$. We are living in a growing hard drive.
