# Global Scientific Integrity Ledger (UET v0.9.0)

> **Goal**: 100% Transparency. No more hiding empirical fits behind "calibration".

| Topic | Name | Integrity Status | Fitted Parameters Found | Action Needed |
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **0.1** | Galaxy Rotation | ✅ **PURE** | None (Axiomatic Restoration) | Refactored to Information Density Law |
| **0.2** | Black Hole Physics | ✅ **PURE** | None (Axiomatic Restoration) | Refactored k=3.0 derivation |
| **0.3** | Cosmology | ✅ **PURE** | None (Axiomatic Restoration) | Refactored Horizon Stiffness Law |
| **0.4** | Superconductivity | ✅ **PURE** | None (Derived from Symmetry/Mass) | **Standard for all others** |
| **0.5** | Nuclear Binding | ❌ **FITTED** | 3-body factor (3.8), Pair binding (4.72) | Pure empirical data matching |
| **0.6** | Electroweak | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Higgs coupling (0.258) | Geometric base but has hand-picked constants |
| **0.7** | Neutrino Physics | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | $\theta_{13}$ scaling ($\pi/16$) | Geometric base, logic is mostly consistent |
| **0.8** | Muon g-2 | ❌ **NOISY** | Conflicting formulas in code/comments | Implementation adjusted to match anomaly |
| **0.9** | Quantum Nonlocality | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Entanglement strength $\beta$ | Geometric math is solid, $\beta$ needs axiom |
| **0.10**| Fluid Dynamics | ❌ **FITTED** | Mobility (225k), Kappa boost (50k) | Heavily tuned for numerical stability |
| **0.11**| Phase Transitions | *TBD* | | |
| **0.12**| Vacuum Energy | ✅ **PURE** | None | Ideal formula matches trend honestly |
| **0.13**| Thermodyn. Bridge | *TBD* | | |
| **0.14**| Complex Systems | ❌ **JUNK** | Shock size (10.0), Damping (0.99) | Purely phenomenological model |
| **0.17**| Mass Generation | ❌ **FITTED** | $\beta$ fixed for each particle | Concept demo, not a derivation |
| **0.18**| Neutrino Mixing | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Mirror of Topic 0.7 | Consistent with 0.7 |
| **0.19**| Gravity GR | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Curvature mapping | Conceptual bridge to Einstein |
| **0.20**| Atomic Physics | *TBD* | | |
| **0.21**| Yang Mills | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Mass gap metaphor | Numerical limit demo |
| **0.22**| Biophysics | ❌ **JUNK** | Population growth loops | Phenomenological, no UET axioms |
| **0.23**| Unity Scale Link | ✅ **PURE** | None (Demo-only) | Perfect for showing scaling patterns |
| **0.24**| AI Foundation | ❌ **FITTED** | Improvement rate (0.92) | Metaphorical toy model |

## Integrity KPIs
- **First-Principles Derived (PURE)**: 5 / 24 (20.8%)
- **Geometric/Partial (Semic-Pure)**: 6 / 24 (25.0%)
- **Empirically Fitted (FITTED)**: 10 / 24 (41.7%)
- **Phenomenological/Toy (JUNK)**: 3 / 24 (12.5%)

## Final Assessment: "The State of Unity"
The audit reveals that while the **UET Template** ($\Omega = V + \kappa|\nabla C|^2 + \beta CI$) is used across all 24 topics, the values of $\kappa$ and $\beta$ are currently "localized". We have not yet achieved a **Global Standard** where one $\kappa$ works for both a Galaxy and a Neuron without ad-hoc scaling. 

**Topic 0.4 (Superconductivity)** is the gold standard of what the rest should become.
