# 🎨 Visual Production Plan: The Big 5
> **Strategy:** Generate specific "Concept Art" for each problem and store it in its own Topic Directory.

---

## 1. 🌌 Problem: Dark Matter (Galaxy Rotation)
*   **Target Directory:** `research_uet/topics/0.1_Galaxy_Rotation_Problem/Result/01_Showcase/`
*   **Existing Asset:** `Research_Galaxy_Curve_Social.png` (Data Plot).
*   **Missing Concept Art:**
    *   **"The Viscous Galaxy":** A galaxy spinning in a thick, gel-like medium (Honey/Sauce) instead of empty blackness. Visible "drag lines" or texture in space.

## 2. 🕳️ Problem: Singularity (Black Holes)
*   **Target Directory:** `research_uet/topics/0.2_Black_Hole_Physics/Result/01_Showcase/`
*   **Existing Asset:** `ultimate_ccbh_analysis.png` (Shadow Sim).
*   **Missing Concept Art:**
    *   **"The Saturated Sphere":** A Black Hole shown not as a hole, but as a hyper-dense, glowing solid ball of information (Maximum Brightness/Density). Like a speaker cone pushed to max excursion.

## 3. 🎈 Problem: Hubble Tension (Expansion)
*   **Target Directory:** `research_uet/topics/0.3_Cosmology_Hubble_Tension/Result/01_Showcase/`
*   **Existing Asset:** Line Charts (Boring).
*   **Missing Concept Art:**
    *   **"The Expanding Pipe":** Visualizing the universe as a pipe getting wider. The fluid inside (Space) changes density/pressure as it flows.
    *   **"Variable Ruler":** Shows a ruler (Constant) stretching along with the fabric of space.

## 4. 💥 Problem: Dark Energy (Decay)
*   **Target Directory:** `research_uet/topics/0.3_Cosmology_Hubble_Tension/Result/01_Showcase/` (Shared with Cosmology) or `0.26_Cosmic_Dynamic_Frame`
*   **Existing Asset:** None.
*   **Missing Concept Art:**
    *   **"The Fermentation":** A visual of space "bubbling" (Percolation).
    *   **"Tomato to Sauce":** An artistic diptych. Left: Solid Tomato (Matter). Right: Decaying Sauce + Gas bubbles (Dark Matter + Dark Energy).

## 5. 🌊 Problem: Grand Unification (Integration)
*   **Target Directory:** `research_uet/topics/0.0_Grand_Unification/Result/01_Showcase/`
*   **Existing Asset:** `Proof_Mind_Result.png` (Abstract).
*   **Missing Concept Art:**
    *   **"The Sand Dune Illusion":** A split screen. Top: Smooth golden dunes (Gravity). Bottom: Zoom in to see billions of individual sand grains (Quantum).

## 🛠️ Next Steps
1.  **Visit each directory.**
2.  **Generate/Place the images.**
3.  **Update the README.md** in that directory to explain the image.
