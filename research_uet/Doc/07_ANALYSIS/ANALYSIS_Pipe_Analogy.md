# 🚰 The Universe is a Pipe: A Simple Guide
> **Concept:** Explaining the hardest problems in physics using the User's "Cylinder/Pipe" analogy.
> **Core Idea:** The Universe is not empty space; it is a **Fluid System** flowing through a 4D Pipe.

## 1. What is Dark Matter? (Viscosity)
**The Problem:** Galaxies spin too fast. Standard physics says they should fly apart.
**The Pipe Analogy:**
*   Imagine water flowing through a giant pipe.
*   The water close to the pipe walls moves slower because of **friction** (drag).
*   The water in the center moves faster.
*   Now, imagine a galaxy is a little wheel spinning inside this water.
*   **Dark Matter** is just the **Viscosity ( ความหนืด)** of the water.
*   The water is thick. It grabs the wheel and helps it spin without breaking.
*   **Simple Truth:** "Space is thick." (น้ำมันหนืด)

## 2. What is Dark Energy? (Pressure)
**The Problem:** The universe is expanding comfortably, but suddenly it's speeding up (accelerating).
**The Pipe Analogy:**
*   Imagine the pipe is getting wider (Expansion).
*   Usually, when a pipe gets wide, water slows down.
*   BUT... imagine there is a massive **Pump** at the start of the pipe pushing water in.
*   **Dark Energy** is the **Information Pressure** (แรงดันน้ำ) from that pump.
*   As the pipe gets wider, the pressure difference creates a suction that pulls the water faster.
*   **Simple Truth:** "The pump is still running." (ปั๊มยังทำงานอยู่ แรงดันเลยดันออกไปเรื่อยๆ)

## 3. What is the Big Bang? (The Nozzle)
**The Pipe Analogy:**
*   Follow the pipe backwards.
*   Eventually, the pipe narrows down to a tiny point—the **Nozzle**.
*   At the nozzle, the water speed is incredibly fast and pressure is insane.
*   **Singularity** is just the nozzle where the flow started. It's not "magic"; it's just where the pipe was smallest.

## 🎯 Summary for Social Media
**"เลิกงงกับฟิสิกส์ ด้วยทฤษฎีท่อน้ำ"**
1.  **Dark Matter** = ความหนืดของน้ำ (Viscosity) ที่ช่วยประคองกาแล็กซี
2.  **Dark Energy** = แรงดันน้ำ (Pressure) ที่ดันให้ท่อขยายตัว
3.  **Gravity** = กระแสน้ำวน (Vortex) ที่ดูดทุกอย่างเข้าหากัน

**UET (Topic 0.26)** พิสูจน์ว่าจักรวาลมีพฤติกรรมเหมือน **"ของไหลในท่อ" (Fluid Dynamics)** จริงๆ ไม่ใช่ความว่างเปล่า.
