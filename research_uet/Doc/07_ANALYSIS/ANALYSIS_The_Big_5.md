## 1. The Constants Crisis (Hubble Tension)
*   **The Problem:**
    *   We measure the Universe's expansion rate ($H_0$) using the Big Bang leftover (CMB) $\to$ get **67 km/s/Mpc**.
    *   We measure it using Supernovae today $\to$ get **73 km/s/Mpc**.
    *   **They don't match ($5\sigma$).** Did the laws of physics change?
*   **The UET Solution (Topic 0.3):**
    *   **"Information Pressure"**: The expansion rate depends on **Information Density**. As the universe expands and density drops, the "pressure" changes. The Constant isn't constant; it evolves.

## 2. The Singularity Problem (Black Holes)
*   **The Problem:**
    *   General Relativity predicts that at the center of a Black Hole, mass collapses to a point of **Infinite Density**.
    *   **"Infinite" means physics breaks.** It's an error in the code of the universe. Nature hates infinity.
*   **The UET Solution (Topic 0.2):**
    *   **"Saturation Limit"**: Information cannot be compressed infinitely. At the Planck scale, space becomes "saturated" (like a zipped file that can't be zipped anymore).
    *   **Result**: Black holes have a solid core of "Frozen Data", not a singularity.

## 3. The Dark Matter Delusion (Galaxy Rotation)
*   **The Problem:**
    *   Stars at the edge of galaxies spin too fast. They should fly off into space.
    *   **The "Band-Aid":** Scientists say 85% of the universe is invisible "Dark Matter" that holds them in.
*   **The UET Solution (Topic 0.1 & 0.26):**
    *   **"Cosmic Drag"**: Space is not empty; it is a **viscous fluid** of information.
    *   **Mechanism**: The spinning galaxy drags space with it, creating a "wake" that boosts velocity. No ghost particles needed.

## 4. The Unification Crisis (Quantum vs Gravity)
*   **The Problem:**
    *   **Gravity:** Smooth, curved space (Einstein).
    *   **Quantum:** Pixelated, random particles (Bohr).
    *   **Conflict:** They destroy each other when combined. We have no "Theory of Everything".
*   **The UET Solution (Topic 0.23):**
    *   **"The Scale Link"**: Gravity *is* Quantum Mechanics seen from far away.
    *   **Mechanism**: Gravity is the "Entropic Force" (statistical pressure) of billions of quantum information bits interacting. They are the same force at different zooms.

## 5. The Expansion Accelerating (Dark Energy)
*   **The Problem:**
    *   The universe isn't just expanding; it's speeding up.
    *   **The "Band-Aid":** Scientists call this "Dark Energy" (Vacuum Energy), but their calculations are wrong by $10^{120}$ orders of magnitude (The Vacuum Catastrophe).
*   **The UET Solution (Topic 0.12):**
    *   **"Vacuum Integrity"**: We admit failure to solve the $10^{120}$ gap perfectly (Honesty), BUT UET explains the *acceleration* as a result of **Entropy Maximization**. The universe expands to create more "room" for information.

## 🎯 Social Media Strategy
**"The 5 Ghosts of Physics"**
1.  **The Ghost Number** ($H_0$ mismatch)
2.  **The Error in the Code** (Singularity)
3.  **The Invisible Mass** (Dark Matter)
4.  **The Broken Bridge** (Quantum Gravity)
5.  **The Unknown Force** (Dark Energy)

UET doesn't fight them. It explains them as **Software Features** of the Universe.
