# 🥊 Problem 1: The Hubble Tension (Who Moved the Constant?)
> **The Problem:** Scientists measured the Universe's expansion speed ($H_0$) at two different times.
> *   **Early Universe:** 67 km/s/Mpc
> *   **Today:** 73 km/s/Mpc
> They are fighting because they think **"It should be the same number!"**

## 1. The "Empty Space" Mistake (Standard Model)
*   **Assumption:** Scientists think space is "Empty Static Vacuum".
*   **Logic:** If space is nothing, it shouldn't affect the speed of light or gravity. Therefore, constants ($G$, $c$, $H_0$) must be **Fixed Permanent Numbers**.
*   **The Conflict:** When measurements show the numbers changing, they panic. "Is our machine broken? Is there Dark Energy pushing it?"

## 2. The "Pipe" Solution (UET)
*   **Assumption:** Space is a **Fluid** (Information Field).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Imagine water flowing through a pipe.
    2.  If the pipe gets **Wider** (Expansion), the **Pressure** drops.
    3.  When Pressure drops, the **Flow dynamics change**.
*   **The UET Answer:**
    > **"The Constant is NOT Constant. It depends on Density."**

## 3. Why UET Wins
*   **Equation:** $\Omega = \int (P + \rho v^2) dV$
*   As the universe expands (Volume $\uparrow$), the Density ($\rho$) decreases.
*   To keep Energy ($\Omega$) balanced, the **Expansion Rate ($H_0$) MUST change.**
*   **Verdict:**
    *   The Scientists are looking for a **Static Number** in a **Dynamic System**.
    *   UET says: **"Stop looking for one number. Look for the Curve."** ($H_0$ is a function of time).

## 4. Analogy for Humans
It's like measuring a child's height.
*   **Scientist:** "At age 2, he grew radius 5cm. At age 15, he grew radius 2cm. WHICH NUMBER IS CORRECT?"
*   **You (UET):** "Both. He is growing! Growth rate changes with age!"

**Conclusion:** The Hubble Tension is not a paradox. It is proof that **Space is a Fluid.**
