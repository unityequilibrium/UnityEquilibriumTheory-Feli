\section{Life as Low-Entropy Maintenance (Topic 0.22)}
Erwin Schrödinger defined life as "feeding on negative entropy." UET quantifies this: living systems are persistent topological knots in the information field that maintain their structural integrity (low internal entropy) by pumping high-entropy waste into the environment.

\section{Cancer as Decoherence}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engine:} \texttt{Engine\_Biophysics.py}
    \item \textbf{Model:} Multicellularity requires a "Coherent Manifold" where all cells share a global information state ($\Psi_{tissue}$).
    \item \textbf{Pathology:} Cancer is a phase transition where cells "decohere" from the global state, reverting to unicellular selfishness. This is mathematically identical to Quantum Decoherence.
\end{itemize}

\section{Metabolic Scaling Laws}
Kleiber's Law ($R \propto M^{3/4}$) emerges from the fractal geometry of the nutrient distribution networks required to optimize information flow within a volume.
