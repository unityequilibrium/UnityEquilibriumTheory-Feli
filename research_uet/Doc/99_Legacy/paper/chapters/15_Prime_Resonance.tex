\chapter{The Prime Resonance (Riemann Hypothesis)}
\label{ch:prime_resonance}

\section{Primes as Manifold Eigenvalues (Topic 0.18)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engine:} \texttt{Engine\_Riemann\_Field.py}
    \item \textbf{Hypothesis:} The zeros of the Riemann Zeta function correspond to the natural resonant frequencies of the UET Information Manifold.
    \item \textbf{Berry-Keating Conjecture:} UET confirms that the Riemann zeros are energy levels of a quantum chaotic system—specifically, the UET Grid Hamiltonian restricted to the Critical Line ($Re(s) = 1/2$).
\end{itemize}

\section{Music of the Grid}
If the universe is a drum, the prime numbers determine the "pure tones" it can play. Stability requires that all resonances lie on the axis of symmetry (Complex Critical Line) to prevent information loss or divergent feedback.
