\chapter{Information Thermodynamics: The Arrow of Time}
\label{ch:thermodynamics}

\section{Time as an Emergent Property (Topic 0.13)}
In UET, time ($t$) is not a fundamental dimension but a derived parameter representing the gradient of entropy production.
\begin{equation}
    dt \propto \nabla S
\end{equation}
If the information state of the universe does not change (static entropy), time ceases to exist.

\section{Resolution of Maxwell's Demon}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engine:} \texttt{Engine\_Thermodynamics.py}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} The engine simulates energy exchange between reservoirs. It explicitly implements Landauer's Principle: "Information is Physical."
    \item \textbf{Cost:} Any attempt by a "Demon" to sort particles (reduce entropy) requires measurement. This measurement increases the information content of the Demon's memory. Erasing this memory to reset the cycle dissipates heat $E \ge k_B T \ln 2$, balancing the total entropy budget.
\end{itemize}

\section{Unruh and Hawking Radiation}
Both phenomena are unified as "Horizon Effects" where the observer's acceleration disrupts the vacuum information equilibrium, manifesting as thermal noise (Temperature).
