\section{The Illusion of Distance}
In UET, 3D space is a projection of a higher-dimensional Information Manifold. Quantum Entanglement is not "spooky action at a distance" but rather "local interaction in topological space." Two entangled particles share the same grid indices ($x_i, x_j$) in the connective dimension, regardless of their separation in 3D.

\section{Derivation of Non-Locality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engine:} \texttt{Engine\_Quantum\_LC\_Unity.py} (Topic 0.9)
    \item \textbf{Mechanism:} The Bell inequality violation emerges from the shared topology. The correlation coefficient is derived geometrically as the overlap of hyper-spheres in the information space.
    \item \textbf{Tsirelson's Bound:} The maximum correlation of $2\sqrt{2}$ is a geometric property of the Information Hypercube.
\end{itemize}

\section{Wave Function as Manifold Vibration}
The Schrödinger equation is derived as the diffusion limit of the Master Equation. The wavefunction $\psi$ represents the local density of information states. Collapse is the update of the manifold configuration upon interaction (measurement).
