\section{Introduction: Universality of the Master Equation}
The UET Master Equation is not limited to subatomic particles. It describes the evolution of \textit{any} system driven by information exchange and geometric constraints.
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \int \left( \kappa |\nabla C|^2 + \beta C \cdot I \right) d^3x
\end{equation}
In this chapter, we apply this equation to three complex systems: Cancer Biology (TCGA), Artificial Intelligence (LLMs), and Economics.

\section{Biophysics: Cancer as Information Collapse}
Cancer is typically viewed as a genetic disease. UET views it as a \textbf{Thermodynamic Phase Transition}.
Normal tissue maintains high geometric stiffness ($\kappa > \beta$), ensuring cellular order.
Cancer occurs when the information density ($\beta$, mutation rate) overwhelms the structural stiffness ($\kappa$, tissue architecture), causing a topological collapse.

\subsection{TCGA Data Analysis}
We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data using the UET Entropy Map. The results in \texttt{topics/0.22\_Biophysics\_Origin\_of\_Life/Code/03\_Research/} show:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Normal Tissue:} High Spatial Coherence ($S_{topo} \to 0$).
    \item \textbf{Tumor Tissue:} High Entropy Flux ($S_{topo} \to \infty$).
\end{itemize}

\section{Artificial Intelligence: The Physics of Intelligence}
Why do Large Language Models (LLMs) obey power laws ($L \propto N^{-\alpha}$)?
In UET, an LLM is a 1D projection of a high-dimensional Information Field. The "Loss" is simply the thermodynamic free energy of the system.

From the synthesis log \texttt{topics/0.24\_Artificial\_Intelligence/Result/1769662240.../summary.json}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stability:} The system converged to `is\_stable: true` with `min\_density: 1.0`.
    \item \textbf{Scaling:} The loss curve follows the UET Entropy Decay prediction exactly.
\end{itemize}

\section{Economics: Examples of Market Efficiency}
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is the economic equivalent of the Quantum No-Cloning Theorem. Information cannot be created or destroyed, only redistributed.

Our simulation in \texttt{topics/0.25\_Strategy\_Power\_Economics/Result/Legacy\_Logs/timeseries.csv} tracks the "Capital Concentration" (Omega Field):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial State:} Gini Coefficient $\approx 0$.
    \item \textbf{Final State:} As time evolves ($t \to 50$), the system naturally stratifies due to the $\beta C \cdot I$ term (Rich-get-Richer dynamics), unless countered by a redistributive potential $V(C)$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion on Unification}
Physics is the study of simple systems. Biology and Economics are the study of complex systems. UET unifies them by showing they are all governing by the same conservation of information.
