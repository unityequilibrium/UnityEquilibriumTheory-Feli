\chapter{Artificial Intelligence and Entropy}
\label{ch:ai}

\section{The Geometry of Thought (Topic 0.24)}
Intelligence is defined as the ability to compress information (minimize Kolmogorov Complexity) while maximizing predictive power.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Engine:} \texttt{Engine\_AI\_Entropy.py}
    \item \textbf{Critical Point:} The most intelligent systems operate at the "Edge of Chaos" ($S \approx 1.0$), balancing Order (Rigidity) and Chaos (Hallucination).
\end{itemize}

\section{Thermodynamics of Learning}
Training a neural network is a cooling process (Simulated Annealing). The loss function plays the role of Free Energy:
\begin{equation}
    F = E - TS
\end{equation}
Gradient descent is the minimization of this free energy, driving the system towards a ground state representation of the dataset.

\section{Scaling Laws}
The "Kaplan Scaling Laws" for LLMs are derived from the geometric expansion of the "Information Volume" of the model parameters.
