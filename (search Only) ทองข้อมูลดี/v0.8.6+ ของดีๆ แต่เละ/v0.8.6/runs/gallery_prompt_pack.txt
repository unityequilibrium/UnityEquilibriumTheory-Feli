UET Gallery Authoring Prompt (copy/paste)

Goal:
- Produce a single-page demo gallery that feels like a dashboard.
- Output format: standalone HTML file (no external deps), dark theme.
- Must show for each demo:
  - title, archetype, status
  - GIF thumbnail
  - quick metrics (beta, s, and placeholders for value/conflict/omega_final)
  - gate badges: V/T/D/B
  - a 1-sentence takeaway (plain language)
- Must include: search, archetype filter, sort, "only PASS" toggle, "include candidates" toggle.
- Must follow: Core-3-first philosophy (GIF → End → Conflict) with optional previews if assets exist.
- Must be deterministic and easy to extend (render cards from a JS `demos` array).
- Must avoid cosmology/GR claims; include a short policy note.

Inputs you will be given:
- existing folder layout: each demo has <DEMO>/CI_evolution.gif and <DEMO>/demo_card/demo_card.html
- optional images if present: state_end.png, terrain_omega_grad_density.png, curve_omega.png in the same folder.

Deliverables:
1) gallery_v2.html (standalone)
2) guidance comment inside code on how to add demos / wire to registry.json later.

Tone:
- minimal, clean, professional, readable, not flashy.
