# Theory: Pauli Exclusion Principle

The Pauli Exclusion Principle in UET arises from the interference patterns of the E-field. Two identical fermions cannot occupy the same state because their fields would destructively interfere, leading to zero energy density at the overlap.

## Key Concepts
- Fermi-Dirac statistics
- Antisymmetric wavefunctions
- White dwarf stability (Fermi pressure)
