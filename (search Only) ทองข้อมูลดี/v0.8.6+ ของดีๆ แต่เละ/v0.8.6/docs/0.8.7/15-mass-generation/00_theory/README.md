# Theory: Mass Generation (Higgs Mechanism)

Mass in UET is generated through the interaction with a background energy field (the "condensate"). This is conceptually similar to the Higgs mechanism but arises from the scalar field potential itself.

## Key Concepts
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking in E-field
- Mass from condensate interaction
- Fermion mass hierarchy
