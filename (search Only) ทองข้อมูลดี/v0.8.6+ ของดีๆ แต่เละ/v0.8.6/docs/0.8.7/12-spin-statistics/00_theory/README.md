# Theory: Spin and Statistics

In UET, spin emerges as a topological property of the E-field. Half-integer spin corresponds to Mobius-like twists in the field lines, while integer spin corresponds to standard closed loops.

## Key Concepts
- Spin-statistics theorem
- Dirac equation in energy field
- Fermion (1/2) vs Boson (1) topology
