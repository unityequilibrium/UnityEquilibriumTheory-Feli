## Abstract

We present UET, a framework where all fundamental forces emerge from 
gradients of a single scalar energy density field E(r,t). The theory:

- Unifies 4 fundamental forces
- Explains dark energy as vacuum energy (w = -1)
- Predicts MOND-like behavior at galactic scales
- Avoids cosmological constant problem
- Passes 52/52 validation tests with 100% stability

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tests Passed | 52/52 |
| Stability Loops | 3/3 |
| Flaky Tests | 0 |
| Fine Structure α | 0.02% error |
| Dark Energy w | -1 (exact) |
| MOND a₀ | 91% match |
